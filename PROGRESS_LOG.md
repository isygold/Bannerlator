## 2026-06-28 (s4) — ▶️ RESUME / CURRENT STATUS: VRR + manual picker built & verified; pacing tweak pending

**Where things stand on the graphics roadmap:**
- **STEP 1 (debanding + NIS): DONE — MERGED to main** (`feat/deband-nis` ff `71e2d27..4565b80`, branch deleted).
  Both device-proven on Vulkan via the new AIO torture cards (banding ramp + scaling combo). Not in a tagged
  release yet (per versioning rule — no stable cut without explicit say-so).
- **STEP 2 (VRR / refresh-rate matching): BUILT + DEVICE-VERIFIED**, branch `feat/vrr-refresh-rate` (off main,
  NOT merged). Took 3 fixes to get the panel to actually move: seamless→ALWAYS (`c29acc0`), capability gating
  (`83da657`), and the big one — window `preferredRefreshRate` was pinning the panel to max and out-voting our
  surface vote (`35dd636`). After that, all 4 states verified on-device (Vulkan, AYANEO 144Hz panel):
  cap+match→60, cap+nomatch→144, uncapped+match→144, incapable→greyed. Clean 60↔144 both directions.
- **Manual refresh-rate picker: BUILT** (`fa77da6`, CI `28333613335` GREEN) — unified 'Refresh rate' drawer
  control (Auto match-FPS + manual snap-to-supported-modes chips, auto-detected via getSupportedRefreshRates;
  Auto greys chips; whole group greys on incapable devices). Editor got a manual FilterChip row. Auto path
  byte-identical (reviewed). DEVICE-TEST OWED.

**Open issue — FPS oscillation (user-observed):** with limiter=60 + Auto-match ON, FPS swings 56↔64 every few
seconds. Two suspects: (1) **AYASpace system refresh control** — the test device is an AYANEO handheld whose
AYASpace overlay has its OWN 'Refresh Rate' control (Auto/144/120/90/60), was pinned to 144; its polling
service likely re-asserts 144 vs our VRR every few seconds (matches the timing). (2) **limiter/VSync beat** —
matching the panel to exactly the cap removes the 144Hz headroom that hid the limiter's pacing jitter (panel
likely 59.94 vs cap 60.0). 

**▶️ NEXT (test plan, before merge):** (1) DIAGNOSTIC — set AYASpace Refresh Rate→Auto, re-test: swing stops =
system contention (config fix, document it), persists = pacing beat. (2) Install build `28333613335`, verify
manual picker (Auto-off+pick 90/120 → dumpsys locks panel to it regardless of cap) + headroom check (manual
120 + cap 60 should be smooth) + auto-path 4/4 regression. (3) If pacing beat confirmed → add **cap-below-
refresh** fix (pace limiter to ~refresh−1 when Auto matching). (4) Then MERGE feat/vrr-refresh-rate (VRR +
manual picker + any pacing fix) to main → then STEP 3.

**Device-driving notes:** measure VRR while game is FOREGROUND (it releases the vote on background); 'go'
handshake + `sleep 12; dumpsys` works. Key greps: activeMode= , setFrameRate=/{10492, the per-layer
`Hz ... Always/OnlySeamless` vote line. Move-cursor-to-touchpoint is ON (tap absolute). Newest device
screenshots in /sdcard/Pictures/Screenshots/.

## 2026-06-28 (s4) — 🆕 Manual refresh-rate picker built (unified Auto + manual control)

On top of the verified VRR, added a unified "Refresh rate" drawer control: the match-refresh toggle is now
"Auto (match FPS)" + a chip row of the panel's supported rates (auto-detected via `getSupportedRefreshRates`).
Auto ON → chips greyed (VRR drives it); Auto OFF → pick a rate and the panel locks to it regardless of the FPS
cap; whole group greys on incapable devices. `applyVrr` extended with an additive manual branch (auto path
byte-identical, reviewed). New state manualRefreshRate/supportedRefreshRates/onManualRefreshChange + Container
`manualRefreshRate` extra + resolver + editor FilterChip row. Commit `fa77da6`, CI run `28333613335`.
Device-test owed: Auto-off + pick 90 → panel locks 90 regardless of cap; chips greyed when Auto on; auto path
4/4 regression. Then merge the whole `feat/vrr-refresh-rate` (VRR + manual picker) to main.

## 2026-06-28 (s4) — ✅✅ VRR device-test #3: WORKING (+ clear-path verified) — panel drops 144→60 to match the FPS cap

Build `28332650876` (seamless fix `c29acc0` + capability gating `83da657` + window-pin fix `35dd636`). On
Vulkan, FPS cap 60, Match-refresh ON, game foreground: **activeMode 144.00→60.00 Hz** — the panel physically
switched. Override `{10492, 60.00 Hz}`, both layer votes now `60 Hz SeamedAndSeamless` (game surface + window
pref agree). VRR is device-proven end-to-end. The `preferredRefreshRate` lever moves this panel, so both
auto-VRR and a future manual refresh-rate picker will work here.

**Before merge:** verify toggle-off/uncapped returns the panel to 144 (clear path); optional GL/ASR spot-check
(shared code, Vulkan proven). **Next feature (green-lit):** manual refresh-rate picker — one control with
'Auto (match FPS)' + manual snap-to-supported-modes (60/90/120/144 auto-detected via getSupportedModes); Auto
greys the slider; whole control greys on single-mode/pre-A11 devices. Same `preferredRefreshRate` lever.


**Clear-path verified (test #3b):** toggling "Match refresh rate to FPS" OFF returned the panel 144 Hz (activeMode 60→144, both votes restored to 144). So VRR does the full round trip — drops to the cap when on, restores max when off. Also verified the cap-dependency: limiter OFF + match ON (uncapped) → panel returns to 144 (VRR only acts while capping). All 4 states confirmed {ON+match→60, ON+nomatch→144, OFF+match→144, incapable→greyed}. **VRR comprehensively verified and ready to merge.**

## 2026-06-28 (s4) — 🐛➡️✅ VRR device-test #2: surface fix confirmed, fixed a 2nd blocker (window pins max refresh)

Re-tested with the seamless fix (`c29acc0`) + capability gating (`83da657`). Our game-surface vote is now correct —
`60.00 Hz Default SeamedAndSeamless` (the force-switch worked; was OnlySeamless). But the panel still held 144
because a 2nd layer voted 144: `XServerDisplayActivity.onCreate` pins `window.preferredRefreshRate = max` (144)
for smooth UI, and that window-level request out-votes the surface vote. **Fix `35dd636`:** new
`applyWindowPreferredRefreshRate(vrrRate)` (called from applyVrr) lowers the window preference to the matched
rate when VRR is capping, restores max otherwise. CI run `28332650876`. Retest: expect activeMode 144→60.
Lesson: an emulator that force-pins preferredRefreshRate to max blocks ANY app VRR vote — keep it in step.

---

## 2026-06-28 (s4) — 🐛➡️✅ VRR device-test #1: found + fixed the "panel won't drop" bug

Tested VRR on-device (AIO, OpenGL renderer, FPS cap 60, Match-refresh ON, game@60). Panel stayed at 144 Hz —
frameRateOverride showed our app un-throttled `{10492, 144}`. Root cause via dumpsys layer line
`60.00 Hz Default OnlySeamless`: our 60 Hz vote WAS placed correctly, but with **seamless-only** strategy, which
a peak-refresh 144 panel ignores. The code bug: `XServerView.applyFrameRateToSurface` only used the 3-arg
`setFrameRate(..., ONLY_IF_SEAMLESS)` when `FRAME_RATE_SEAMLESS_ONLY` was true, else fell through to the 2-arg
overload — which **also defaults to ONLY_IF_SEAMLESS**, so the "force" path was never taken.

**Fix `c29acc0`:** when SDK≥31, pass the strategy explicitly — `ONLY_IF_SEAMLESS` if seamless-only else
`CHANGE_FRAME_RATE_ALWAYS` (force the mode switch). CI run `28331250229`. Retest owed: reinstall, re-measure
(expect override→cap, activeMode drop). Notes: 40 fps is an awkward cap for a 144 panel (144/40=3.6) — use 60;
container was GL, also test Vulkan; if ALWAYS still won't drop it's device display policy, not our code.

**➕ Capability gating (`83da657`, CI `28332020195`):** the "Match refresh rate to FPS" toggle is now **greyed out** on devices that can't do VRR — `XServerView.isDisplayVrrCapable(display)` = SDK>=30 AND >1 distinct refresh rate among supported modes; gated in the in-game drawer (XServerDrawerState.vrrSupported, seeded at launch) + the ContainerDetail editor (probes the default display), with an "Unavailable on this display" hint. Single-mode/60Hz-only + pre-Android-11 → disabled. Build 28332020195 includes BOTH this AND the seamless-only fix `c29acc0`, so it supersedes 28331250229 — install THIS one for the retest. User's 144/120/90/60 panel = capable → toggle stays enabled.

**Same-device test protocol (1-thing-at-a-time):** VRR releases its vote on background (onStop→0), so measure
while the game is foreground — user stays in game, sends "go", switches back; I fire `sleep 12; dumpsys` to
capture with the vote reapplied. Confirm foreground via topResumedActivity.

---

## 2026-06-28 (s4) — 🆕 STEP 2: VRR / refresh-rate matching IMPLEMENTED (branch `feat/vrr-refresh-rate`, device-test owed)

Step 1 (debanding+NIS) merged to main earlier today; started Step 2 = make the panel refresh rate follow the
game FPS via `Surface.setFrameRate` votes (complementary to the FPS limiter: limiter=render rate, VRR=display
rate). One Surface-level vote on the parent SurfaceView covers all 3 host renderers (GL / Vulkan compositor /
SurfaceFlinger-ASR) since SF aggregates frame-rate votes over the layer subtree; existing Vulkan native child-SC
votes left intact.

5 commits on `feat/vrr-refresh-rate` (off main, pushed, NOT merged):
1. `4882473` XServerView.setDisplayFrameRate(float,int) — SDK_INT>=30 guard, picks active holder Surface,
   remembers last rate + re-asserts in surfaceChanged (added a holder callback to glSurfaceView which had none).
2. `4671c26` applyVrr()/reapplyVrr()/resolvedMatchRefreshRate() in XServerDisplayActivity — votes 0 when
   off/uncapped, `cap` normally, `cap×mult` in the lsfg-governs case; wired into applyFpsLimit + onStop(release)
   + onResume(reassert) + drawer onMatchRefreshChange.
3. `dcbefb5` Container `matchRefreshRate` extra (default ON) + shortcut resolver.
4. `2b603e5` drawer "Match refresh rate to FPS" toggle + XServerDrawerState flow.
5. `5ff90db` ContainerDetail editor switch + strings.

Reviewed rate logic + cross-layer contract names (sound; `getFrameGenMultiplier()` confirmed to exist).
CI run `28330068467` ✅GREEN (all flavors compile). No release/tag cut.

**▶️ DEVICE-TEST (user starting now):** `dumpsys SurfaceFlinger | grep -i frameRate` to confirm the panel takes
the vote. Verify: vote = cap when capped, cap×mult under lsfg, clears (0) when toggle-off/uncapped, re-asserts
bg→fg. **PREREQ: turn the FPS limiter ON + set a cap** (VRR only votes when capped; limiter is the existing
pre-feature, VRR just matches the panel to it). Needs a high-refresh panel (dumpsys shows the modes).
**Renderer priority:** Vulkan first (full stack, most likely to land) → OpenGL → SurfaceFlinger/ASR last + most
scrutiny (relies on SF aggregating the parent-Surface vote to the native child SC; if it doesn't land there →
do optional commit 6 = native ASurfaceTransaction_setFrameRate on the game child SC). Everyday use: Vulkan.
Risk: setFrameRate is a HINT (battery-saver may ignore).

## 2026-06-28 (s4) — ✅ VULKAN RETEST PASSED on new AIO torture cards → `feat/deband-nis` CLEARED TO MERGE

User built the AIO Graphics Test with the Banding scene + new "Scaling Tests >" sub-page (builder used the
exact scene ids from the brief: scaletest_combo/zoneplate/wedge/grid/checker/edges). Switched the AIO shortcut
to the **Vulkan** renderer (1280x720→1080p upscale) and drove it on-device:
- **Debanding (banding card, dark 0..16/255 ramp):** OFF = ~12 hard stair-step bands; ON = bands dissolved into
  fine dither grain. Max diff exactly 1/255, mean diff ~3x the smooth Space scene. The visual proof we couldn't
  get on Space/Nebula.
- **Scaling modes (combo card, grid patch sharpness std-dev):** none=linear 0.0590 (identical → None≡Linear
  label quirk), sgsr 0.0689, fsr 0.0693, **NIS 0.0757 (sharpest clean upscaler)**, nearest 0.0936 (blocky
  aliasing). All live-switch, all distinct; SGSR/FSR/NIS reconstruct cleanly above Linear.
- Host compositor confirmed Vulkan via drawer layout (CAS/Debanding). NOTE: AIO HUD "Renderer" line mislabels
  (showed "OpenGL" on the combo) — trust the container renderer, not that label.

**BOTH gate halves PASSED on Vulkan → `feat/deband-nis` is cleared to merge (awaiting user go-ahead).** Then
STEP 2 = VRR. Optional cleanup: None≡Linear label + CAS/Sharpen slider-snapping.

## 2026-06-28 — 🎨 `feat/deband-nis` FULLY DEVICE-PROVEN (NIS both renderers + Debanding) → MERGE-READY

**Branch `feat/deband-nis` (tip `cc3361f`, off main, PUSHED, NOT merged).** Detail memory =
`project_bannerlator_smooth_sharp_render_roadmap.md` (STEP 1). Device test driven via root bridge on the
SAME device (Adreno 750), AIO graphics test app, renderer = **OpenGL | DXVK**.

**NIS (NVIDIA Image Scaling, upscaler mode 7) — re-confirmed on GL (Space scene 720p→1080p):**
- ✅ **NO Adreno runtime-compile crash** selecting NIS on the GL renderer — the one big open risk (heavy
  unrolled NIS shader) is definitively cleared; scene keeps rendering. (Already proven on Vulkan in s2.)
- ✅ **Perf cost now measured** (was unbenchmarked): **290fps → 200fps (~31%)**, GPU load 72%→~86%. Still smooth.
- ✅ **Quality** (clean frozen-frame montage None/Nearest/Linear/NIS): NIS = crisp edges + detail preserved,
  distinct from blocky Nearest & soft Linear, no artifacts → NVScaler math correct. RMSE vs `none`: NIS 0.54%.
- ✅ **Sharpness slider** present, continuous, seeds 75, registers 0/100. Modulation confirmed qualitatively
  (clean pixel-delta elusive — the AIO Pause releases on a slider drag; first 4.9%/0.6% numbers were motion-contaminated, discarded).

**Debanding (terminal TPDF dither pass) — device-verified on GL Space scene (frozen-frame A/B):**
- ✅ Toggle works (drawer, below HDR); ON reveals "Dither strength" slider (seeds 100).
- ✅ **Max pixel diff = EXACTLY 1/255 (one 8-bit LSB)**, mean ~0.04/255 — textbook dither magnitude.
- ✅ **Mean brightness perfectly preserved** (0.282483→0.282532) — no bias/tint (hallmark of correct dither).
- ✅ Diff footprint = fine uniform noise across gradients (atmosphere/planet/moon), ~zero in black sky/saturated.
- ⚠️ **CAVEAT:** no dramatic "bands→smooth" before/after on Space — its gradients are dark/shallow + broken by
  stars/detail, so little gross banding to dramatize. Dither provably correct at LSB level; Space ≠ a showcase.
  **For a striking visual demo → AIO "Detailed Nebula" scene (next test).**

**🔎 SIDE-FINDING (cleanup candidate, unfixed):** in this build **None ≡ Linear EXACTLY** (RMSE 0) — base "None"
is doing bilinear; base-sampler labels (None/Linear/Nearest) worth a look. Pairs with the known CAS/Sharpen
slider-snapping inconsistency (GL 5-notch vs VK continuous).

**Debanding RE-TESTED on "Detailed Nebula" (s3, GL, frozen-frame A/B):** mechanism re-confirmed (game-area
max diff = exactly 1/255, mean-preserving); positive dither-footprint = fine stipple noise, ~8.8% of pixels in
the glow falloff nudged 1 LSB, densest at quantization boundaries. BUT even hard-amplified on the brightest
smooth ramp, OFF vs ON look identical — Nebula shows NO gross banding to dramatize either. CONCLUSION: AIO
test scenes render gradients clean enough that 8-bit banding is minimal in both Space & Nebula; debanding's
gain is real but sub-perceptual on THIS content (will matter on real games w/ heavy banding — fog/skyboxes/UE).
Build is dither-only on 8-bit chain (precision-bump step deferred). Note: whole-frame RMSE is meaningless here
(drawer changes between shots) — always crop to game area x>900.

**▶️ NEXT — ⛔ MERGE ON HOLD (user decision 2026-06-28):** do NOT merge `feat/deband-nis` yet. All prior
tests ran on AIO Space/Nebula scenes, which don't visibly band and barely separate upscalers (smooth content)
→ only proved debanding/scaling mathematically, not visually. GATE before merge: (1) AIO Graphics Test gets
its Banding scene (already built, commit `881f39e`, 1 past v1.6.0 — needs push+build+install) + new
Scaling-Test scenes (spec'd, not built — briefs in /sdcard/Download/SCALING_TESTS_BUILD_BRIEF.md +
BANDING_SCENE_FINDINGS.md) → (2) install new AIO binary → (3) **retest on the VULKAN renderer** with real
torture content (debanding on the dark 0..16/255 ramp, in-app dither OFF, scaling=None/1:1;
NIS/SGSR/FSR/FSR-Fit on zone-plate/wedge/grid at sub-native render-res). THEN merge if it passes → THEN STEP 2
= VRR. Optional: precision-bump (10-bit/R16F intermediate) would make debanding visibly stronger — revisit
only if a real game shows banding.

## 2026-06-28 — 🧩 BIONIC-FG: Track-3 FSR3 Optical Flow built + `.so` delivered for manual injection (NOT device-tested)

**Resume context for the bionic-fg frame-gen shader-pool / model-expansion effort.** Detail memory =
`project_bannerlator_bionic_fg_shader_pool.md`. Fork = `The412Banner/bionic-fg`, clone `/home/claude-user/bionic-fg-fork`.

**WHAT GOT DONE THIS SESSION:**
- ✅ **Track 3 = FSR3 Optical Flow added as runtime model 3.** Branch `feat/fsr3-optical-flow-model`
  (off `b0c2e5c`), commits `d6f4a09`(embed FSR3 OF SPIR-V idx66-69 + restore dropped `IsValidSpirv`) →
  `9f06376`(model-3 dispatch + clamp→3) → `5eb11a7`(GLSL src+docs) → `603d26e`(CI workflow). PUSHED, unmerged.
  Source = FidelityFX-SDK optical-flow passes (MIT), reimplemented subgroup-free GLSL for Turnip/no-DXC.
  15 OF passes → reuse model-0 warp/blend/synth back half. Models 0/1/2 byte-unchanged (additive).
- ✅ **Built `libbionic_fg.so` (arm64-v8a).** NEW self-build workflow in the fork `.github/workflows/build-so.yml`,
  CI run `28323607624` **GREEN** (NDK r26b 26.1.10909125 / android-26, matches app). No external patch needed —
  the single-device anti-deadlock fixes (fork commit `ac2f5c0`) are already an ANCESTOR of Track-3, so the
  source self-contains models 0/1/2/3 + single-device `create(device,…)` + manifest `disable_environment`.
- ✅ **Delivered to device for manual inject:** `/sdcard/Download/libbionic_fg.so` (6.3M, md5 `971e6aaa…`) +
  `/sdcard/Download/VkLayer_BIONIC_framegen.json`. User will inject + test LATER.

**🔑 CRITICAL ARCH FINDING (corrects prior records):** the app does NOT compile bionic-fg in its main NDK
build (no `add_subdirectory(bionic-fg)`); the layer ships as a **prebuilt asset**
`app/src/main/assets/bionic-fg/libbionic_fg.so`, built by the SEPARATE manual `build-bionic-fg.yml`. So the
recorded "model-2 app CI GREEN" only bundled the OLD prebuilt `.so` — **shipped layer = `9136405c` (Jun 21),
pre-model-1/2/3.** Models 1/2/3 + the shader_02 fix were NEVER in any shipped layer until this new `.so`.

**▶️ WHAT TO DO LATER (resume):**
1. **User injects + device-tests the new `.so`** — replace `<imagefs root>/usr/lib/libbionic_fg.so`,
   set `model = 3` in `…/home/<container>/.config/bionic-fg/conf.toml` (UI only writes 0/1), FG enabled.
   ⚠️ **CLOBBER CAVEAT:** `ImageFsInstaller.installBionicFgLayer` re-stages the OLD bundled asset whenever
   on-device size ≠ bundled size → inject right BEFORE launching or it reverts. Also worth testing model 2 (V2).
2. **Triage results:** FSR3 OF is compile-proven only — main risks = PERF (heavy SAD motion search; tunable
   search window `BR`/`SR` in `of3_flow.comp`) + visual correctness. shader_02 fix + model 2 also first-ever on device.
3. **If we want to ship for real** (not just inject): rebuild the bundled asset — either dispatch the app's
   `build-bionic-fg.yml` AFTER refreshing/removing the now-redundant 608-line `patches/bionic-fg-bannerlator-fixes.patch`
   (stale; fixes already in source), OR repoint that workflow to build the fork branch like `build-so.yml` does;
   then commit the new `.so` to `assets/`, bump versionCode (NOT a release per [[feedback_bannerlator_release_versioning_rule]]).
4. **Roadmap Tracks 4 & 5 BLOCKED on toolchains** (no sudo): Track 4 Lossless DXBC→SPIR-V needs `vkd3d-compiler`
   (meson/widl/spirv-headers all missing); Track 5 RIFE/IFRNet needs an `ncnn` build. Revisit when toolchains available.

## 2026-06-28 — 🛠️ BUILT: Debanding + NIS upscaler (branch `feat/deband-nis`, CI pending, NOT device-tested)

Implemented Track-1 step 1 from the master plan below. **Branch `feat/deband-nis` off main, 6 commits
`194b7b9`→`cc3e0e7` (+log `a53a226`), PUSHED, NOT merged, NOT device-tested.** Shaders compile clean
(glslangValidator), all cross-layer contracts reviewed+consistent. **CI ✅ GREEN — run `28319416413`
(build-artifacts.yml, all flavors; only a harmless Node-20 deprecation annotation).** First real compile of the
C++/JNI/Java/Kotlin passed. NEXT = on-device A/B (see ⚠️ below), then merge.

**DEBANDING** — terminal TPDF/IGN dither pass (float-only hash, Adreno-safe), `deband.frag`+header,
appended LAST as `FX_DEBAND`, registered in fxOn in BOTH planUpscaleFrame AND recordUpscalePasses
(known "scaling drops chain" bug avoided). `setDeband(bool,int strength)` JNI↔C++↔Java; GL `DebandEffect`
+ dedicated terminal slot in EffectComposer (render() + renderUpscaled()). strength 0..200 → /100 LSBs
(default 100 = ±1/255). Session-live (not persisted).

**NIS** — new upscaler mode int **7**. Faithful NVScaler port from authentic NVIDIA reference (MIT)
into single-pass `nis.frag` (edge map + 6-tap scale/USM + directional filters + CalcLTI + luma recolor);
**exact fp32 coef_scale/coef_usm baked as `const float[384]`** (transcribed programmatically from
NIS_Config.h, NOT hand-typed, first-row verified); fp32 path (no fp16/bitwise); NO 2nd descriptor binding.
Reuses existing sharpness slider. GL `NISEffect` + EffectComposer `case 7`. Engages only when render
res < display (like SGSR mode 3). Drawer: `7 to "NIS"` + mode-7 sharpness in both GL+Vulkan blocks.

**⚠️ Needs device-verification (agent's honest flags):** (1) NIS math not pixel-compared to a reference
NIS — A/B on the high-freq SPACE scene 720p→1080p, GL AND Vulkan. (2) GL NISEffect runtime-compiles a
heavy unrolled NVScaler + 2×384 const arrays on the Adreno GLES driver = the runtime-compile-crash class
the roadmap flags — DEVICE-TEST GL NIS specifically (Vulkan NIS is precompiled SPIR-V, safer). (3) NIS =
37 texture fetches/fragment, perf untested. (4) CI is the first real compile of the non-shader code.

## 2026-06-28 — 🗺️ MASTER PLAN: Graphics smoothness/sharpness roadmap + App theming/icons

> **STATUS: RESEARCH + RECON + 1 HTML MOCKUP + CODE-GROUNDED PLANS ONLY. NOTHING CODED, NOTHING
> COMMITTED, NOTHING DEVICE-TESTED.** This entry consolidates a full session of exploration into one
> plan. Deep detail (every file:line touchpoint) lives in the two memory files:
> `project_bannerlator_smooth_sharp_render_roadmap.md` + `project_bannerlator_theming_icons.md`.

Two parallel tracks scoped this session. Recommended first build = **debanding + NIS** (Track 1, small/visible/low-risk).

---

### TRACK 1 — SMOOTHNESS + SHARPNESS RENDERING

**User goal:** keep games EXTREMELY SMOOTH, NO FPS loss (ideally gain), + clarity/sharpness.

**Core principle (the answer):** it's a STACK, not one effect →
**render a bit lower → spatial upscaler (sharp) → VRR refresh-match (smooth) → debanding (clarity).**
That gains real FPS, cuts heat/power, adds sharpness, zero added latency.
**Myth busted:** frame-gen does NOT give free FPS — it inflates the HUD number while costing GPU + latency
(a perceived-smoothness layer, optional cherry-on-top for single-player base≥45fps).

**Recommended build order:**
1. **Debanding + NIS** ← START HERE (ready, ~6 commits, low-risk)
2. **VRR / `setFrameRate`** (refresh-rate matching; biggest smoothness-per-effort; SurfaceFlinger path best home)
3. **Curated shader-loader platform** (force-multiplier; compile `.spv` OFFLINE in CI = Adreno-crash-safe; permissive-licensed shaders only)
4. **Moonshot: DXVK depth → true SGSR2 on TAA/FSR2 games** (XL, staged, multi-repo)
5. Keep frame-gen (`bionic-fg`) gated/off-by-default, labeled as a latency trade.
**DROP:** BFI, Anime4K-CNN, pixel-art scalers, heavy CRT (royale), NPU/AI super-res — each costs FPS or doesn't fit.

**Scorecard (vs goal):** SGSR1/NIS/FSR1 ★★★★★ · CAS / shader-loader-platform ★★★★ · 3D-LUT / panel-calibration / estimated-MV-temporal ★★★ · Anime4K(CNN heavy) / pixel-art / adaptive-sharpen(already have CAS+RCAS) / heavy-CRT ★★ · BFI ★½ skip.

**READY-TO-BUILD PLAN — Debanding + NIS (GL + native Vulkan; ASR path runs neither chain):**
Shared plumbing: Vk post shaders `cpp/winlator/*.frag` + committed `*_frag.h` SPIR-V (gen via
`glslangValidator -V x.frag --vn x_code -o x_frag.h`, NO CI compile step). `VulkanRendererContext.cpp`
`createPostPipelines`~:552 / `recordUpscalePasses`:1074 / `planUpscaleFrame`:1235 / locked effect-chain
:1204-1229 / SINGLE-sampler `createDSLayout`:402-407 (don't add a 2nd binding) / PC range 88B.

**STAGED MOONSHOT — SGSR2 (XL, MULTI-REPO):** VERDICT — shipping a patched DXVK is mechanically fine
(we build/ship own DXVK `.tzst` in `assets/dxwrapper/`, extract `XServerDisplayActivity.java:2582`). REAL WALL =
guest→host transport: today only 1 buffer (color) crosses via DRI3 1-AHB=1-FD (`DRI3Extension.java:141`
`modifiers==1255`); the SENDER of extra buffers lives in the guest Wine/WSI build (NOT this repo → wine-compat +
guest build). PREREQ A.0: add a sub-1.0 internal-res lever (renderScale only supersamples ≥1.0 today). **Stage A
depth** (med, useful alone → unlocks DoF/SSAO): patch DXVK to export chosen depth as **R32F** AHB (sidesteps Adreno
depth-AHB limits), new DRI3 `modifiers==1256`, depth import variant, prove via depth-grayscale DEBUG pass. **Stage B
SGSR2** on TAA/FSR2 games (they give MV+jitter free): new 2-pass-FS shaders, persistent history buffer, 4-binding
descriptor for SGSR2 only, per-title jitter profile, auto-fallback SGSR2→SGSR1→passthrough, Vulkan-compositor-only
(ASR can't). **Stage C generic = research wall** (jitter can't be generically injected) — spike only.
**Smallest prototype:** 1 FSR2/TAA game → DXVK export depth-only R32F → accept 1256 → grayscale debug overlay;
if frame-aligned depth correct, transport PROVEN, rest is shader math; else STOP.

**SurfaceFlinger/ASR renderer (the 3rd host renderer) findings:** it hands the guest buffer STRAIGHT to the system
compositor — NO programmable pass, so the upscaler/effect shaders CAN'T live there (by design = its speed/battery win).
What it CAN uniquely add: `setFrameRate`/VRR (best home for #2 above), present-fence timing into the HUD, scaling/aspect
geometry modes, true HDR10 passthrough (speculative), layer alpha/damage. Already wired: setBuffer/geometry/visibility/zorder.

### TRACK 2 — APP THEMING + BUTTON ICONS

**Deliverable in hand:** interactive HTML preview (live theme switch, dark/light, accent slider, typography
before/after, 4 screens with icon fixes, offline-safe inline SVG) at device
`/sdcard/Download/bannerlator_theme_icons_preview.html` (+ scratchpad + `~/Downloads/`).

**Finding:** the app ALREADY has a theme engine (`ui/theme/Theme.kt`/`ThemePreset.kt` = 8 presets + HSV picker
`AppearanceScreen.kt`) → this is POLISH not a rebuild. Brand accent `#0055FF` (`Color.kt:8`).
**3 weaknesses:** light mode is DEAD CODE (`toLightColorScheme` exists, `_isDarkMode` hardcoded true, no toggle);
no Material You; ~730 hardcoded color literals bypass the theme (custom accent only paints PART of app until centralized).

**Proposals:**
- 3 new themes (live in the HTML): **★Midnight Cobalt** (rec, evolves brand blue; primary `#2F6DFF`/accent `#6FA8FF`/bg `#0E1117`) · **Phosphor Terminal** (retro CRT amber+green, dark-only) · **Carbon & Ember** (graphite+orange `#FF7A33`). Rec: ship Midnight Cobalt default + keep AMOLED + add Phosphor preset.
- **Typography ramp** (high ROI, ~10 lines `Theme.kt`): app forces weight 600 on ALL text → give head700/body400/label500.
- Un-disable light mode (setter+toggle); optional Material You preset API31+.
- **Icon gaps:** store detail pages (`store/{Steam,Epic,Gog,Amazon}GameDetailActivity.kt`) are TEXT-ONLY buttons → add `Icons.Filled.{PlayArrow,Download,Update,Delete,InsertDriveFile,CloudUpload}`; text "←"→`ArrowBack`; Epic "✓ Installed"→`CheckCircle`; game-card placeholder `OpenInNew`→`SportsEsports`; magnifier "✕"→`Close`. `material-icons-extended` already a dep. **Highest-ROI = store action-button icons (pure additive).**

**3-bucket app-wide reach verdict:** (a) AUTO once colors centralized = all out-of-game Compose UI + in-game magnifier;
(b) small recolor fix = in-game DRAWER `XServerDrawer.kt` (wrapped in theme, inherits fonts, but ~40 hardcoded colors → stays blue under a custom accent);
(c) feed accent MANUALLY = FPS/perf HUD (`widget/FrameRating*.java`, `PerfHudView.java`), on-screen controls (`InputControlsView.java`), legacy XML editors — via existing bridge `AppThemeState.getCurrentAccentArgb()`.

**Theming sequencing:** 1) typography ramp 2) store-button icons + back-arrows 3) centralize ~730 colors per-screen 4) Midnight Cobalt + Phosphor 5) light-mode toggle + optional Material You.

### NEXT MOVE
Start coding **Track 1 → debanding + NIS** (commits 1-6, CI-green, then user device-tests on the SPACE scene before SGSR2 spike). Everything above is durable in the two memory files; this log entry is the master index.

## 2026-06-27 — 🏷️ 2.0 STABLE RELEASE CUT

Merged the #18 turnip-ICD branch to main, bumped to **2.0 (versionCode 32)**, rewrote the README
"What's New in 2.0" + feature sections, and cut the **2.0 stable release** (run `28309799973`,
prerelease:false + make_latest:true → now the Latest the in-app updater offers; 3 flavor APKs +
update.json attached). Closed PR #24 (not merged).

**Everything in 2.0 since 1.9.2:** OpenGL renderer upscaler parity (SGSR/FSR/Sharpen) · sharpness
sliders retuned (0=off→100=max, SGSR doubled, Sharpen 5-stop snap, inverted-CAS fix) · OpenGL
filter-mode + glBlitFramebuffer plumbing (P4) · **game + container card redesign (#19)** ·
**auto-close session on game exit** · magnifier fix on Vulkan (#22) · FEXCore "Performance (TSO)"
preset (#20) · **Android-10 direct-ICD turnip driver (#18)**.

README/release note imageFS-reinstall reminder added (new turnip driver lives in imageFS).
Pinged issue #18 reporter (SD845/A10) to verify the new `turnip-26.1.0` driver — issue left open
pending their confirmation (no A10 device locally).

---

## 2026-06-27 — #18 direct-ICD turnip path for Android <11 (built, CI-green, awaiting reporter A10 test)

Diagnosis: the reporter's A10/SD845 problem is the driver LOADING MECHANISM — Bannerlator loads
turnip via adrenotools (linkernsbypass hook, needs ~A11+); Winlator loads it as a plain system
Vulkan ICD (works on any Android). Also closed PR #24 (strlcpy/snprintf — original code already
safe).

Branch `feat/turnip-icd-direct-android10` off main (`f43a319`), commits `60038cf` + `971c415`,
CI `28309292459` ✅ green, **NOT merged, NOT device-tested** (no A10 hardware here). New driver
option `turnip-26.1.0` (Winlator's Mesa Turnip 26.1.0, ICD format) that installs the freedreno
ICD + .so into the guest, points `VK_ICD_FILENAMES` at it, and **skips the adrenotools env**
entirely — bypassing the A11+ hook. Picker filter special-cased to gate on `isAdrenoGPU()` (the
normal adrenotools probe is exactly what fails on A10). Adrenotools path untouched; default still
turnip-sdk36. Top residual risk: host-vs-guest path assumption (if proot-remapped, library_path
would need a guest path). NEXT: reporter verifies a CI build on their SD845 → then merge.

## 2026-06-27 — Implement open issues #22 (magnifier) + #20 (FEX Performance+TSO preset)

gl-upscaler-parity merged to main (`6d5f75b`). Branch `fix/issues-22-magnifier-20-fextso` off
main, CI build `28308479676` ✅ green. **User device-confirmed both work → MERGED to main (ff
`6d5f75b..ecb8646`, branch deleted, no tag); GitHub auto-closed #22 and #20.**

**#22 magnifier (`d7a736e`):** `showMagnifierOverlay()` cast the renderer to `GLRenderer` and
no-op'd the zoom callback for anything else → on the default Vulkan renderer the overlay opened
stuck at 100% with dead +/- buttons. Now uses the `HostRenderer` interface (get/setMagnifierZoom
implemented by all 3 renderers; Vulkan applies it live via `updateTransform`). The other
GLRenderer cast in `showScreenEffectsDialog` is correct (effects are GL-only) — left as-is.

**#20 FEX "Performance (TSO)" preset (`55fb879`):** fetched the issue screenshot — the reporter's
preset is Performance with **only `FEX_TSOENABLED=1`** (vector/halfbarrier/memcpy TSO stay off,
x87-reduced + multiblock on), the lightweight single-TSO-flag variant. Added `PERFORMANCE_TSO`
to `FEXCorePreset` + a `getEnvVars` block + `getPresets` entry + `performance_tso` string.
Additive, no DB migration; auto-appears in the spinner and Compose container/shortcut editors.

NEXT: CI green → device-test (#22 magnifier on a **Vulkan** container; #20 pick preset + launch a
TSO game) → merge to main.

---

## 2026-06-27 — Open-issue triage + scopes (#22 magnifier, #20 FEX TSO preset) — QUEUED

Scoped while the gl-upscaler-parity slider CI built. To be implemented on a **fresh branch off
main AFTER the gl-parity sliders device-test + merge** (user: "after we device test we will
tackle them both").

**#22 — magnifier doesn't work / zoom — ROOT CAUSE FOUND (high confidence):**
`XServerDisplayActivity.showMagnifierOverlay()` (~line 3339) casts the renderer to
**GLRenderer only** and the zoom callback early-returns when it's not GL. The **default
renderer is Vulkan**, so the Magnifier overlay opens, shows 100%, and the +/− buttons are dead.
Confirmed clean fix: `HostRenderer` interface already declares `get/setMagnifierZoom` (all 3
renderers implement it) and `VulkanRenderer.setMagnifierZoom` calls `updateTransform()` → zoom
applies live. **Fix = use the `HostRenderer` reference instead of the GLRenderer cast** (~3
lines, 1 file). Optional: `ASurfaceRenderer.setMagnifierZoom` lacks a redraw trigger (add
`updateScene()`). Device-test on Vulkan (can fold into the slider session).

**#20 — Add FEX "Performance + TSO" preset:** the built-in PERFORMANCE preset sets
`FEX_TSOENABLED=0`; many games need TSO. **Fix = add a new "Performance (TSO)" built-in preset**
(Performance base + the 4 TSO flags on: TSOENABLED/VECTORTSOENABLED/MEMCPYSETTSOENABLED/
HALFBARRIERTSOENABLED=1, X87REDUCEDPRECISION=1, MULTIBLOCK=1) across `FEXCorePreset.java` +
`FEXCorePresetManager.java` (getEnvVars + getPresets) + `strings.xml`. No DB migration (presets
stored by id). Verify exact flags vs the reporter's screenshot.

**Also noted:** #18 (bundle brunodev Winlator turnip 26.1.0 for A10/SD845 — packaging easy but
adrenotools load may need A11; needs an A10 device) and PR #24 (bounded strlcpy/snprintf in
android_sysvshm.c — review + merge candidate).

## 2026-06-27 — GL upscaler parity: device-test, inverted-slider fix, sharpness-range tuning

**Branch:** `feat/gl-upscaler-parity` (off main `ec3bcb0`). Phase 1 (SGSR/FSR/Sharpen on the
OpenGL EffectComposer + drawer Scaling-mode picker, commits `efd5f4f`→`327ab9d`) was already
CI-green (`28306036455`). This session = device-test + fixes. NOT merged.

**Device test (build 1.9.2 vc31, AIO-Graphics-Test-32bit = OpenGL + 1280x720 on 1080p panel,
DX11 SPACE scene, frozen-frame A/B via drawer Pause):** GL parity LIVE — all 6 scaling chips
produce DISTINCT output on the GL renderer (frozen-frame re-upscale works). RMSE vs None:
Linear 0% (≡None ⇒ default sampling IS bilinear) · Nearest 1.51% (blocky) · Sharpen 0.36% ·
SGSR 0.68% · FSR 0.79% (crispest). Cursor stays crisp under Nearest = PASS (host cursor
exempt from point-scale). Zoomed montages confirm visual distinctness.

**🐛 Bug found + fixed (`52c7092`):** the upscale "Sharpness" slider was INVERTED for the
Sharpen mode (AMD CAS) — raising it SOFTENED. Root cause = `FSREffect`'s level scale is
inverted (level 1 = CAS sharpness 0.90 = sharpest, level 5 = 0.12 = softest) but both CAS
call sites mapped slider straight onto level. Fix: `EffectComposer.buildPickerCas():339`
`level=(1-upscaleSharpness)*4+1` + `XServerDisplayActivity.onSgsrUpdate:2088`
`level=(100-sharpness)/25+1`. SGSR (EdgeSharpness=1+s*1.333) and FSR RCAS (stops=1-s) were
already correct → untouched. CI `28307366153` triggered then cancelled (superseded below).

**✅ Slider-effectiveness tuning DONE + committed (graphics-vulkan-engineer, GL + Vulkan):**
every sharpness slider now spans **0 = nothing (neutral, no sharpening; upscale still runs)
→ 100 = max**, ZERO shader recompiles (all host-side push-constant / pass-gating math).
Final effective values, slider 0/50/100:
- GL SGSR EdgeSharpness **1.0 / 2.33 / 3.67** (`1.0+s*2.666` — span doubled, neutral floor 1.0)
- GL FSR RCAS lobe scale **0.0 / 0.5 / 1.0** (`clamp(sharpness,0,1)` — 0 = true passthrough)
- GL Sharpen mode 6 (snapped {0,25,50,75,100}) **OFF / CAS 0.50 / CAS 0.90** (0 = no CAS pass)
- GL "Sharpen (CAS)" toggle (snapped) **OFF / 0.50 / 0.90**
- Vulkan SGSR edge **0.5 / 2.5 / 4.5** (`0.5+s01*4.0` — span doubled)
- Vulkan FSR/Sharpen RCAS con.x **0.0 / 0.5 / 1.0** (`upscaleSharpness01` linear, 0 = passthrough)
- Vulkan CAS toggle **OFF / 0.5 / 1.0** (`casOn = casEnabled && casSharpness>0`)
Snap = `XServerDrawer.kt` IntSlider `steps` override (5 stops only in mode 6 + always for the
Sharpen(CAS) toggle; SGSR/FSR/Vulkan-Sharpen stay continuous). No over-drive past RCAS/CAS
ceiling → no ringing. Commits `beebb17` (GL SGSR-double + FSR 0=neutral) · `fac47ed` (GL Sharpen
5-stop snap + 0=OFF) · `0718c39` (Vulkan mirror). CI build **`28307792454`** ✅ green all 3 flavors.

**✅ GL device-test PASSED (AIO space scene, OpenGL|DXVK Adreno 750, live drawer-open method):**
Sharpen slider **snaps to 0/25/50/75/100** (tap ~38% → snapped to 50). FSR slider **0 = true
passthrough** (crop png 218 KB, softer than None's 245 KB, no sharpening) → **100 = strongly
sharp** (420 KB, +92%). SGSR **0→100 = +18% png**, montage shows visibly crisper limb/coastlines
(doubled range). 0 = neutral confirmed. Vulkan mirror = code-verified (shared host logic) but
not device-tested this session (AIO shortcut is OpenGL). Note for next time: this AIO test
**exits the scene on BACK while paused**, so the frozen method was abandoned — open the drawer
once via BACK while running, then switch chips live without pause/BACK. NEXT: merge gl-parity to main.

**❌ Dropped per user:** a persisted per-shortcut "upscaling on/off" toggle. Clarified that
720p→1080p plain stretch is ~free (final-blit sampler); only opt-in SGSR/FSR cost GPU and are
already default-None + session-live. User said "leave the upscaling alone."

## 2026-06-27 — P4 "Lean GL path" (render-upgrades roadmap, final phase) — steps 1+3

**Status:** branch `feat/p4-lean-gl-1-3` off main `35fd80d` (pushed). 2 commits. CI
`28304623016` (`build-artifacts.yml`, all 3 flavors) running. Baseline main build
`28304103719` ✅ green (known-good fallback). NOT merged; device-test pending.

**Context:** Vulkan render-upgrades (P1 SGSR/FSR framework, P1b/1c CAS/HDR/sliders, P2 the
5 GL effects → Vulkan, + native-mutex) are all DONE + on main. P3 (ReShade `.fx` engine)
DROPPED. **P4 = the last phase**, and it targets the *Java GL renderer only*.

**Recon (graphics-vulkan-engineer, read-only):** the roadmap's framing — "reduce
GLSurfaceView overhead" — is mostly the wrong target. In the default config (DRI3 on) the
game frame is **already zero-copy** on GL via AHardwareBuffer→EGLImageKHR (`GPUImage`), so
there's no per-frame CPU upload to kill. EGL context is already GLES3 (`XServerView.java:89`)
despite `GLES20.*` calls → GLES3 APIs available today. Real gaps: `setFilterMode` is a dead
no-op on GL; no low-res→cheap-upscale path; full-frame `glTexSubImage2D` only on the
SHM/DRI3-off/cursor path; effect chain renders base into a full-res FBO even for 1 effect.
GameHub's `libxserver.so` is proprietary but its "direct scanout" rides the same AHB/EGLImage
primitives we already own → P4 = clean-room reimpl with in-tree CAS/SGSR/FSR, nothing
license-blocked. Ladder = 5 rungs; this batch = the low-risk 1–3.

**Implemented (this batch):**
- **Step 1 — `f7e0670` setFilterMode real on GL.** `GLRenderer.java`: new `windowTexFilter`
  field; `setFilterMode(int)` maps `2→GL_NEAREST else→GL_LINEAR` (matches Vulkan convention),
  applied in `renderDrawable` ONLY when `material == windowMaterial` so the **cursor stays
  LINEAR**. Launch hook `XServerDisplayActivity.java:1785`
  `renderer.setFilterMode(container.getRendererFilterMode())` gated `instanceof GLRenderer`
  (was dead/unreachable before — nothing called `HostRenderer.setFilterMode`; Vulkan drives
  filtering via `setUpscaler`). `getRendererFilterMode()` verified to exist (`Container.java:497`).
- **Step 2 — PBO async upload — ❌ DROPPED.** First CI failed to compile
  (`Texture.java:153 int cannot be converted to Buffer`): this project's compileSdk exposes
  only the `Buffer` overload of `GLES30.glTexSubImage2D`, not the int-offset (PBO) variant →
  a PBO can't feed the texture, so no benefit (`glTexImage2D`-with-offset would realloc every
  frame, slower than the sync path). Cleanly reverted (`Texture.java` diff vs main now empty).
  Deferred, not delivered. Lesson: don't assume Android GLES30 int-offset texSubImage exists.
- **Step 3 — `c085dd9` glBlitFramebuffer for trivial copy stage.** `EffectComposer.render()`:
  null-material (pure-copy) pass now goes through `blitReadBufferTo` (GLES30
  `glBlitFramebuffer`, COLOR_BUFFER_BIT, LINEAR, scissor disabled) instead of program-bind +
  textured quad. ALL real shader passes (Color/FXAA/Toon/CRT/NTSC/CAS) + the source-less
  `drawFrame` scene render are UNCHANGED — only the degenerate null-material branch changed
  (which also fixes an old clear-then-draw-nothing→black bug). Bit-identical with-effects output.

**Deferred:** Step 4 (low-res render-target → cheap upscale = the actual "GameHub feel" win,
higher risk: letterbox/scissor + keep cursor full-res) and Step 5 (drop GLSurfaceView for an
owned EGL/SurfaceView present thread). Step 2 (async CPU-path upload) would need a non-PBO
mechanism given this SDK's bindings.

**Confidence:** step 1 = would-work/needs-device-proof (sampler state only, no fast-path
regression); step 3 = would-work (bit-identical for shipped effects). No SDK in the agent env
→ correctness proven by CI compile + device test, not local build.

**Next:** CI green → device-test (GL renderer + Filter toggle nearest/linear; confirm cursor
stays sharp; effects still composite) → merge to main. No tag/release (artifacts only).

## 2026-06-27 — #19 follow-up: Layout L wired + A/L card chooser

**Status:** branch `fix/shortcut-name-overflow` (pushed). Commit `324bb4a` (L + chooser) +
audio-drop follow-up edit. Compile CI `28300618235` (`main.yml`) running on `324bb4a`;
audio-drop fix needs a re-run after its commit. NOT merged.

**Ask:** user said "wire up L so I can choose between the two" — make the list-view card style
user-selectable between the existing layout A and the chosen layout L.

**Implementation:**
- `ShortcutsViewModel.kt`: persisted `useLayoutL` pref (`shortcuts_prefs` / `list_card_layout_l`,
  default `false` = A) mirroring `isGridView`; `setUseLayoutL()`.
- `ShortcutsScreen.kt`:
  - Top-bar **A/L toggle** — an "A"/"L" Text `IconButton`, shown only in list view (hidden in
    grid). Keyed the top-bar-actions `LaunchedEffect` on `(isGridView, useLayoutL)` so the toggle
    reflects live state (was `Unit` → captured stale values; the existing grid icon only updated
    via content recompose).
  - List branch now picks `ShortcutItemLayoutL` vs `ShortcutItem` on `useLayoutL`.
  - New `ShortcutItemLayoutL`: same 48×64 poster cover; subtitle = `container · resolution`;
    PRIMARY `FlowRow` of bright `CompChip`s — renderer (`ChipRendColor`), DXVK, frame-gen
    (`ChipFgColor`, "Bionic-FG" / "LSFG-VK"); SECONDARY `FlowRow` of `SecondarySpec` (7dp colour
    dot + dimmed `OnSurfaceVariant` 10sp label) — driver, VKD3D, backend (`ChipCpuColor`).
  - Renderer / frame-gen / backend resolved via `shortcut.getExtra(key, container.getX())`
    (`getRenderer` / `getFrameGenEngine` / `getEmulator`); backend name via
    `R.array.emulator_entries` + `StringUtils.parseIdentifier`.
  - **Refactor:** extracted the shared ⋮ menu into `ShortcutOverflowButton` (own `menuExpanded`),
    now used by BOTH A and L so the menu can't drift.
- **Audio dropped** from L's secondary (follow-up edit) to match `docs/shortcut_card_L_final.html`
  — lets driver · VKD3D · backend sit on one row. First commit `324bb4a` wrongly included it.
- **Deferred:** backend preset suffix ("FEXCore · TSO" / "Box64 · Perf" in the mockup) — needs the
  async `Box64PresetManager` / `FEXCorePresetManager`, too heavy to resolve per list-card; backend
  shows the emulator name only for now.

**Next:** commit audio-drop fix → CI green → device-test (both layouts render + pref persists
across the toggle and app restart) → merge → close #19. ⚠️ save-before-device-test rule.

## 2026-06-27 — Issue #19 "Name of games is empty" + game-card redesign

**Status:** branch `fix/shortcut-name-overflow` (pushed, NOT merged). Layout A build CI `28299970224` running.

**Root cause (#19):** in `ShortcutsScreen.kt` list-mode `ShortcutItem`, the right-aligned
resolution+DXVK/VKD3D info column had no width bound. In a `Row`, unweighted children are
measured before the weighted name column gets the remainder, so a long version string (e.g.
a DXVK/VKD3D nightly with a commit id in its name) grew unbounded → collapsed the weighted
name column to 0 width ("name is empty") AND pushed the trailing ⋮ overflow menu off-screen.

**Iterations on the branch:**
- `1dd8d4d` interim: capped info column `widthIn(max=120dp)` + ellipsize. Device-tested by user
  → fixed the blank name but now TRUNCATED the component versions (not acceptable).
- `e496040` interim: split DXVK/VKD3D onto own lines, wrap to 2 lines, cap 140dp.
- `b598adb` (current tip) **Layout A redesign**: replaced the info column with a 3:4 poster
  cover (reuses `shortcut.icon`, same bitmap the grid uses) + name/container + graphics
  components as colour-coded chips on a wrapping `FlowRow` (`CompChip` helper + 4 chip colors,
  `ExperimentalLayoutApi`). Long version strings wrap to another chip line / grow the row
  taller instead of clipping. CI building (`28299970224`).

**Design exploration (HTML mockups, rendered via headless chromium, saved to /sdcard/Download):**
- `docs/shortcut_card_layouts.html` — 6 layouts A–F (poster, square-icon+chips, hero banner,
  16:9 spec grid, two-tier stat strip, current-for-comparison).
- `docs/shortcut_card_layouts_dense.html` — 6 denser layouts G–L that ALSO show renderer
  (OpenGL/Vulkan/SurfaceFlinger), frame-gen (off/bionic/lsfg), audio (ALSA/PulseAudio) and
  x86 backend (FEXCore/Box64/wowbox64 + box64/FEX preset). Real values pulled from arrays.xml
  + ShortcutsScreen.
- `docs/shortcut_card_L_final.html` — **user likes layout L** (bright primary chips
  renderer·DXVK·frame-gen + muted secondary line driver·VKD3D·backend), **audio dropped per
  user so the secondary line fits one row / card is shorter**. Resolution moves into subtitle.

**NEXT:** user wants to SEE the layout A build on device first, but LIKES L → likely wire L
(swap the FlowRow chip cloud for L's two-tier primary/secondary) on the same branch. L needs
3 more shortcut extras resolved in ShortcutItem: `renderer`, `frameGenEngine`, `emulator`
(+ box64Preset/fexcorePreset). Keys all confirmed present.

## ⚠️ WORKFLOW RULE — save before device tests / heavy jobs

We **device-test on the same physical device that hosts the working session** (PRoot/Termux + the app under
test are on one device). A device test, app install, screenshot/diff batch, or large agent/workflow can OOM and

## 2026-06-27 (latest) — 🚀 Release 1.9.2 (stable patch)

Opacity fix device-confirmed working by user → cut **1.9.2** stable patch. Bumped `app/build.gradle`
versionCode 30→31, versionName 1.9.1→1.9.2 (`84b6bc1`), pushed main, dispatched `release.yml`
(run `28295471682`) with tag `1.9.2`, title `Bannerlator 1.9.2`, make_prerelease=`false`
(→ prerelease:false + make_latest:true). Workflow builds all 3 release APKs + generates/attaches
update.json (vc31) so the in-app updater offers it to stable users.

**What 1.9.2 ships (since 1.9.1):** full Vulkan effect suite — P1 SGSR + FSR1 upscalers (`5f5a4a0`),
P1b sharpen + render-scale, P1c CAS + fake-HDR + sharpness sliders, P2 FXAA/Toon/Color/CRT/NTSC screen
effects; Native-Rendering ↔ presets mutex; Linear default scaling mode; on-screen-controls overlay-opacity
drop-shadow fix (`1d9439e`). Plain numeric tag = stable per the versioning hard rule (patch X.Y.Z allowed
on explicit user request).

**✅ PUBLISHED — release run `28295879200` succeeded.** 1.9.2 is **Latest**, prerelease=false, all 3 flavor
APKs + `update.json` (vc31) attached → in-app updater offers the OTA to 1.9.1 (vc30) installs. Release body
rewritten to the polished 1.9.1-style layout (logo → ✨What's New → 📥Downloads → 🙏Credits → changelog)
with a full **graphics credits table**: SGSR ([SnapdragonStudios/snapdragon-gsr](https://github.com/SnapdragonStudios/snapdragon-gsr), BSD-3),
FSR/Sharpen ([GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR), MIT),
CAS ([GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-CAS](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-CAS), MIT),
FSR-Fit/compositor blueprint ([utkarshdalal/GameNative](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative), GPL-3.0 — approach reimplemented, not copied),
and HDR/FXAA/Toon/CRT/NTSC/Color (upstream Winlator-Ludashi GLES2 effects ported to Vulkan). Attributions
sourced from the bundled shader headers at `app/src/main/cpp/winlator/*.frag`, which retain their upstream
license text. ⚠️First run `28295471682` FAILED at the update.json step — `release_notes` had literal
double-quotes that broke the bash `NOTES="..."` assignment (exit 127); re-ran with shell-safe plain notes.

**📝 Release-copy accuracy pass (post-publish body edits, no rebuild).** User flagged the marketing line
("only Winlator fork with both real spatial upscalers and a complete post-processing chain on Vulkan —
previously all OpenGL-only"). Verified in source against the other forks and corrected it:
- **GameNative** = FSR1-only on the Vulkan compositor (the blueprint we built on).
- **WinNative** (`/home/claude-user/winnative`) = **SGSR-only** on its Vulkan compositor (`cpp/winlator/vk/shaders/sgsr1.frag`
  + `SGSRUpscaler.java`) **plus an effect chain broader than ours** (sharpen/CRT/HDR/NTSC+NTSC2/Toon/ColorAdjust/
  ColorGrade/ColorBlind/Vivid/Scanlines/Pixelate/Natural); its `fsr.glsl` is only in the cnc-ddraw wrapper, not the compositor.
- So "real upscaler on Vulkan" and "full effect chain on Vulkan" are **NOT** unique to us; only **both SGSR *and* FSR1
  together** on the default path is. Also the upscalers were brand-new, not "previously OpenGL-only" (only the effects were).
- Rewrote the 1.9.2 intro: dropped the superlative, credited GameNative as FSR-on-Vulkan pioneer, noted SGSR exists in
  other Pluvia forks, claimed only the verified differentiator (both upscalers together). Also split What's New so
  **Render scale (supersampling)** is labeled *set before launch* (container/shortcut) vs the drawer-live upscalers/effects.
  Applied via `gh release edit 1.9.2 --notes-file` (APKs/update.json/Latest unchanged).

## 2026-06-27 — Native-mutex merge + on-screen controls opacity shadow fix

**1. Native-Rendering ↔ presets mutex MERGED to main.** User device-tested the latest `feat/vulkan-native-mutex`
build and confirmed it good. Fast-forwarded `main` `506ac6a`→`1c9c576` (`3ed78bb` mutex + `1c9c576` toast
black-box fix + Linear default scaling mode), pushed `origin/main`, deleted the feature branch local + remote.
The full Vulkan graphics program (P1 / P1b / P1c CAS+HDR / P2 effects / native-mutex) is now all on main.

**2. On-screen controls opacity bug FIXED** — `app/.../inputcontrols/ControlElement.java`, commit `1d9439e` on
main, CI run `28294667670` ✅ GREEN (all 3 flavors). **Device-test PENDING.**
- *Symptom (user, device screenshots 100% vs 6%):* at low Overlay Opacity the A–F keyboard strip fades fully, but
  the 4 compact keys MRB/BKSP/SPACE/ENTER keep a solid blue filled square while only their label text fades.
- *Root cause (pulled both screenshots to confirm):* NOT the fill paint — the GameHub `fillColor` already tracks
  `gameHubDim`. It was the **drop shadow**: the BUTTON draw path calls `paint.setShadowLayer(..., 0x401C85FE)`
  (hardcoded blue, alpha `0x40`) before the fill, and that shadow alpha never scaled with opacity. At low opacity
  the fill/stroke/text vanish but the blue glow persists — on the compact `SQUARE` keys it reads as a solid blue
  background; on the wide `ROUND_RECT` pills (A–F) it smears out and looks invisible. That asymmetry = the bug.
- *Fix:* added `int shadowColor = Color.argb((int)(0x40*gameHubDim*effectiveOpacity),0x1C,0x85,0xFE)` and used it
  in both `setShadowLayer` calls (trigger + non-trigger BUTTON paths). 0% opacity now truly vanishes. Only the
  BUTTON case has a shadow; STICK/D_PAD/TRACKPAD/RANGE_BUTTON unaffected.
- *Next:* CI green → install → device-test opacity at low values across both key shapes.

## 2026-06-27 — Phase 2: remaining GL screen effects → Vulkan post chain

**Branch `feat/vulkan-effects-p2`** (off `main` `71dceca`), commit `5dfcdbf` + fix `77c6b76`. Builds on the
now-merged P1/P1c Vulkan post-process framework. NOT merged.

**Device test (space scene):** all 5 effects work individually — Color/Brightness (washes out at 95), Toon
(edge outlines + posterized), CRT (RGB chromatic-aberration on stars), NTSC (horizontal chroma bleed). NTSC+CRT
2-effect combo renders clean. **Bug found + fixed (`77c6b76`):** with a *scaling* mode (SGSR/FSR/Sharpen/downscale)
active, the screen effects were silently dropped (toggles on, image clean) — `recordUpscalePasses`' local `fxOn`
only checked `cas||hdr`, so the scale pass treated itself as final and skipped the chain. Now includes all 7 effects.
(This also fixes P1c CAS/HDR, which had the same gap on the scaling path.) **Fix rebuilt: branch tip `aed6cde`, CI build `28290066760` ✅ green (all 3 flavors).** **Fix device-verified on the
space scene:** SGSR + CRT now shows the CRT fringing/scanlines on the upscaled image (was dropped pre-fix), and
SGSR + NTSC + CRT (3-deep chain) renders both effects cleanly — no black screen/corruption. **Phase 2 is
device-proven** (Color/Toon/CRT/NTSC visually confirmed + the scaling-chain fix; FXAA wired, subtle by nature).
Branch tip `0593385`. **Merged to main (ff `eee9d57`), branch deleted; artifacts build `28291121833` ✅ green.**

**Phase 3 (ReShade-style `.fx` engine) DROPPED 2026-06-27.** The upscalers (SGSR/FSR/Sharpen/downscale) are
resolution-reconstruction passes wired into the compositor — not ReShade-style fixed-res filters, so they stay hardcoded
(the headline differentiator). The cosmetic effects (CAS/HDR/FXAA/Toon/Color/CRT/NTSC) are fully covered by the curated
hardcoded set with better perf/reliability on mobile/Turnip. A data-driven engine only pays off for user/community
extensibility without rebuilds, which isn't a goal. **Effects work is complete.** Remaining: P4 (lean native-GLES2 GL path)
+ the queued overlay-opacity button-fill bug. The Vulkan renderer now carries the full stack: SGSR/FSR/Sharpen upscalers +
CAS + fake-HDR + FXAA/Toon/Color/CRT/NTSC, all on the default path.

Ported the 5 remaining GL-only screen effects onto the **same** Vulkan post chain as composable controls,
at full GL parity:
- **Color** — Brightness / Contrast / Gamma sliders (replicates `ColorEffect.java`: brightness `clamp(s/100,-1,1)`,
  contrast `clamp(s/100,0,2)` so negative contrast is a no-op like GL, gamma `clamp(0.1,5)`; neutral 0/0/1 ⇒ pass skipped).
- **FXAA · Toon · CRT · NTSC** — toggles (GL shader math ported verbatim).

**Locked canonical chain order** (best results): `composite → scale (SGSR/FSR) → FXAA → Toon → Color → CAS → HDR
→ NTSC → CRT → swapchain` — AA first, stylize/grade the clean image, sharpen, bloom, then the output-medium
emulation last (NTSC analog signal, then the CRT tube). The fixed 2-effect chain from P1c was generalized to an
ordered 7-effect list, ping-ponging `fx1`/`fx2` (2 buffers suffice); the last active effect writes the swapchain,
earlier ones write `offscreenRenderPass` fx targets (auto-barriers). Engages even at scaling mode 0/1/2.

5 new shaders (`fxaa/toon/color/ntsc/crt.frag` + compiled `*_frag.h`), 10 new pipelines (Off/Swap per effect),
all PC structs ≤ 28 B (≤ the 88 B shared range, unchanged). Plumbing mirrors P1c: 5 JNI entry points,
`VulkanRenderer.setScreenEffects(b,c,g,fxaa,toon,crt,ntsc)`, `XServerDialogState.onVulkanScreenEffectsApply`,
a "Screen Effects" subsection in the Vulkan drawer block, and launch-seed + callback wiring in
`XServerDisplayActivity`. **No-op safety:** with zero new effects enabled, control flow is identical to current main
(no regression to shipped P1/P1c behavior). Touched: `{fxaa,toon,color,ntsc,crt}.frag`(+`.h`),
`VulkanRendererContext.cpp/.h`, `vulkan_jni.cpp`, `VulkanRenderer.java`, `XServerDialogState.kt`, `XServerDrawer.kt`,
`XServerDisplayActivity.java`. `docs/render_upgrades_report.html` already shows P2 in-progress + the locked chain order.

---

## 2026-06-27 — Vulkan CAS + fake-HDR + sharpness sliders (Phase 1c) + on-device upscaler proof

**Branch `feat/vulkan-cas-hdr`** (off `feat/vulkan-upscaler-sgsr-fsr` tip `80c6d56`), commit `4fecbc6` +
docs `181500c`. **CI build `28287630767` ✅ GREEN** (standard/ludashi/pubg). NOT merged. Device-test pending.

**On-device upscaler verification (the resume from the smooth-blob test).** Re-ran the frozen-frame A/B on the
**DX11 "space" scene** (textured planet + coastlines + dense starfield), 720p container → 1080p panel, build 1.9.1:
the scaling modes are now clearly and usefully distinct (RMSE vs None ≈ 6× the smooth blob's <0.4%):

| Mode | RMSE vs None | On screen |
|---|---|---|
| Nearest | 0% (≡ None) | hard stair-step jaggies on the planet limb (point) |
| Linear | 1.79% | jaggies smoothed but whole frame softened |
| **SGSR** | 1.75% | edges cleaned, stars/detail stay crisp — sweet spot |
| **FSR / FSR-Fit** | 1.82% | same family as SGSR |
| **Sharpen** | 2.46% | brighter/punchier (RCAS), keeps base jaggies |

The earlier "no visible difference" was **bad test content** (smooth SDF blob, no high-freq edges), not a bug —
spatial upscalers are an edge-cleanup whose effect grows with the upscale ratio. "More RMSE" ≠ "better"; fidelity to
a native render is the goal. This test motivated the P1c sharpness sliders (strength was locked at 0.25).

**Phase 1c — three new composable Vulkan post controls + one rename:**
- **CAS toggle + "CAS Sharpness" slider (0–100, default 60)** — the same AMD CAS the GL path uses (`cas.frag`
  ported from `FSREffect.java`), layered on top of any scaling mode, runs even at native res.
- **HDR toggle** — the same fake-HDR (`hdr.frag` ported from `HDREffect.java`, HDRPower 1.30, binary).
- **"Sharpness" slider** for scaling modes SGSR/FSR/FSR-Fit/Sharpen — unlocks the real upscaler sharpness
  (was hard-coded 0.25 RCAS stops; default slider 75 keeps 0.25). SGSR `EdgeSharpness` moved const→push-constant.
- **GL "SGSR" → "Sharpen (CAS)"** — the GL toggle was never SGSR; it's AMD CAS sharpening at native res. Label-only.

Pipeline: `recordUpscalePasses` rewritten to chain `composite → scale → CAS → HDR → swapchain`, with optional
`fx1`/`fx2` intermediates ping-ponged through `offscreenRenderPass` (auto-barriers via its baked subpass deps; no
hand-rolled `vkCmdPipelineBarrier`). Cross-binding the swapchain-render-pass scale pipelines into an
`offscreenRenderPass` fx target is legal — both passes use `VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM` (format-compatible). All PC
structs ≤ 88-byte range. Touched: `cas/hdr/sgsr.frag` (+ compiled `*_frag.h`), `VulkanRendererContext.cpp/.h`,
`vulkan_jni.cpp`, `VulkanRenderer.java`, `XServerDialogState.kt`, `XServerDrawer.kt`, `XServerDisplayActivity.java`.
Drawer-only / session-live (no DB persist), like the scaling mode. `docs/render_upgrades_report.html` updated with
the device-test results + P1c.

## 2026-06-27 — Vulkan spatial upscalers + sharpen + supersampling (Phase 1/1b)

Branch `feat/vulkan-upscaler-sgsr-fsr` (NOT merged). First fork with real SGSR **and** FSR1 upscaling on the
default Vulkan renderer, plus native-res sharpen and supersampling — in one app. Full design/provenance log:
`docs/SGSR_HDR_VULKAN_PLAN.md`; per-renderer summary `docs/render_upgrades_report.html`.

**Built a Vulkan post-process framework** in `app/src/main/cpp/winlator/VulkanRendererContext.cpp` (offscreen
composite target at game res → post/upscale pass → swapchain), then layered features on it:

- **Scaling mode** (in-game drawer, live, Vulkan-only): None / Linear / Nearest / **SGSR** / **FSR** / **FSR (Fit)** /
  **Sharpen**. Modes via `VulkanRenderer.setUpscaler(int)` 0–6. Upscalers engage only when the game renders below
  display res; **Sharpen (6)** runs FSR RCAS at any res incl. native.
- **Supersampling ("Render scale")** — pre-launch container + per-game-shortcut setting Off/1.25x/1.5x/2x (stored via
  `renderScale` extra, no DB migration). Launch multiplies the X11 render res (aspect-preserve, clamp 7680x4320, even
  dims); compositor runs a new Lanczos-2 `downscale.frag` via `setHqDownscale(true)`. DSR/OGSSAA-style.
- **Per-renderer Graphics tab** — shows ONLY the active renderer's controls (OpenGL→SGSR/HDR+ScreenEffects;
  Vulkan→Scaling mode; SurfaceFlinger→"no enhancements" note) instead of greying out the rest.

**Shaders bundled** (offline-compiled to `.spv` C-array headers, license headers retained): SGSR 1.0 (Qualcomm,
BSD-3), FSR1 EASU+RCAS (AMD, MIT), Lanczos downscale. Approach for FSR-in-compositor / FSR-Fit credited to GameNative.
**HDR deferred** (Android WSI rarely exposes an HDR10 surface; revisit later).

**Commits:** `5f5a4a0` native upscaler + drawer · `28ab22d` per-renderer tab · `c3cbe49` Phase 1b sharpen+supersampling
· docs `33ad5f4`. **CI:** Phase 1 GREEN (`28276691564`, `28277238762`); full Phase-1b build `28277821185` ✅ GREEN
(all 3 flavors). **DEVICE-UNTESTED** — next step is on-device: sub-native upscale modes, native-res sharpen, 1.5x
supersampling, and per-renderer tab. Then **Phase 2** = port GL effects (FXAA/CRT/Toon/NTSC/color) to Vulkan.

CI for this repo is MANUAL: `gh workflow run build-artifacts.yml --ref <branch>`.

## 2026-06-25 — 1.9 STABLE cut ✅ (SurfaceFlinger renderer + DXVK 3.0 / Vulkan 1.4)

Merged `feat/surfaceflinger-renderer` to main (ff `d915798`), bumped to **1.9 / versionCode 29** (`eb39c2b`),
and cut **1.9 stable** (release run `28215839109`, `make_latest`, `update.json` attached → in-app updater
offers it on the stable channel). User explicitly authorized promoting to stable ("release 1.9").

**Shipped in 1.9:**
- **SurfaceFlinger (ASR) renderer** — experimental third host renderer, opt-in behind a reboot-risk warning
  dialog, default off. Ported from GameNative PR #1582 (André Vito) on StevenMXZ's scanout work.
- **DXVK 3.0 / Vulkan 1.4** option in the Turnip/Wrapper Driver Configuration.
- **Fixes:** per-game DXVK/VKD3D download sheet no longer hides behind the settings dialog; perf HUD labels
  SurfaceFlinger correctly.

**No imagefs reinstall required** — the 1.9 diff is purely app-side (renderer engine, a bundled native lib,
an env-var option, UI). No `imagefs/`, `assets/`, or `imgVersion` change; existing containers are untouched.

Release description was rewritten to the 1.8 layout with credits to GameNative (André Vito) + StevenMXZ for ASR.

## 2026-06-25 — SurfaceFlinger (ASR) renderer Phase 1 ✅ WORKING + device-proven (branch `feat/surfaceflinger-renderer`)

Took the SurfaceFlinger renderer from "selectable skeleton" (Phase 0) to a working scene compositor
that renders real D3D games fullscreen via Android SurfaceFlinger — no GL/Vulkan compositor. Ported
from GameNative PR #1582 (André Vito, on StevenMX's scanout work), adapted to Bannerlator's X-server API.

**Build-up:** scene engine (`ASurfaceRenderer` implements `WindowManager.OnWindowModificationListener`
+ `Pointer.OnPointerMotionListener`; `updateScene` walks the window tree under XLock → one SurfaceControl
layer per window via `nativeRegisterWindowSC`/`nativeUpdateWindow` in a begin/apply transaction; frames
pushed via `nativeSetWindowBuffer`) + additive `PresentExtension` ASR branch (routes the game AHB to the
SC; Vulkan/GL paths untouched).

**The hard debugging (device, Adreno 750, GTA IV + AIO Graphics Test, DXVK 3.0 + VK 1.4):** game ran
(audio) but showed a small top-left window. On-device logging (filtered logcat to a file — wine logs flood
the buffer) proved the whole Java chain worked (8000+ `ASR_Present`/pushes with valid AHBs, SC registered,
visible). Two stacked root causes, both fixed:
- **`Drawable.DRAWABLE_ASR_MODE`** (`98861c8`): port GameNative's flag so every Drawable is backed by a
  composer-compatible `GPUImage` AHB at construction (`data = AHB mapped memory`) — required for
  SurfaceFlinger to scan out. Wired `setAsrMode(true/false)` per renderer in `XServerView.initRenderer`.
- **Geometry** (`bf292bf`): `computeWindowRect` used the normalized GL `sceneScaleX` (~1.0), pinning the
  game at native size in the corner. Map through `viewTransformation.aspect` (surface-px-per-X-px, e.g.
  1.5×) + letterbox offset instead → fills the surface.
- **HUD** (`bf292bf` + `c4f6e5f`): wired `ASurfaceRenderer.setHudFrameTick` (FPS was blank — the tick was
  Vulkan-only) + fixed the renderer label (`XServerDisplayActivity:1710` binary vulkan?:OpenGL → +SF case).

**✅ DEVICE-PROVEN** (build `28213017959`, screenshot-every-5s/60s): GTA IV menu renders FULLSCREEN under
ASR, HUD reads `SurfaceFlinger | DXVK | … FPS: 398 2.5ms`, stable. **✅ GL/Vulkan regression pass:** all
three renderers render GTA fullscreen with correct labels/FPS (Vulkan 300, OpenGL 295, SurfaceFlinger 398)
— additive edits don't disturb GL/Vulkan, global ASR flag clears correctly. **✅ Debug logging stripped**
(`bb64f2b`, clean build `28213752314`).

Branch tip `bb64f2b`, carries the merged Vulkan 1.4 commit. **NOT merged** — awaiting call: merge to main vs
Phase 2 polish first (CPU desktop chrome compositing, cursor, fps-limit tearing — none block game render).
Process note: always `git push` BEFORE dispatching a CI build (a build was once cut from the pre-push commit;
verify via `gh run view <id> --json headSha`). 1.9-pre prerelease when cut.

---

## 2026-06-25 — DXVK 3.0 Vulkan 1.4 option ✅ merged + SurfaceFlinger renderer Phase-0 spike 🚧

**Context:** DXVK 3.0 shipped (all 4 `.wcp` flavors on The412Banner/Nightlies). DXVK 3.0 **hard-requires
Vulkan 1.4** (mandatory bump from 2.x's 1.3 — verified vs the release notes). The Turnip/Wrapper Driver
Configuration "Vulkan Version" dropdown capped at 1.3, so the wrapper exported `WRAPPER_VK_VERSION=1.3.x`
and DXVK 3.0 refused to init even on a VK1.4-capable driver.

**Fix — Vulkan 1.4 option (`785fe2b`, branch `feat/vulkan-1.4-dxvk3`, CI `28205826581` ✅ → ff-merged to
main 2026-06-25).** One-line: added `<item>1.4</item>` to `arrays.xml` `vulkan_version_entries`. Default
kept **1.3** (safe; 1.3-only drivers/A6xx unaffected) — user picks 1.4 manually for DXVK 3.0. Value flows
generically: dialog → `graphicsDriverConfig` `vulkanVersion=` token → `XServerDisplayActivity:2149` appends
the driver patch → `WRAPPER_VK_VERSION` env. **Proved load-bearing at the binary level:** disassembled the
bundled `libvulkan_wrapper.so` — `wrapper_GetPhysicalDeviceProperties` does `getenv("WRAPPER_VK_VERSION")` →
`sscanf` → `VK_MAKE_API_VERSION` → `str` into `pProperties->apiVersion` (offset 0), the exact field DXVK 3.0
gates on. Caveat: override is unconditional (no clamp to real driver max) → on A6xx (Turnip caps at 1.3)
picking 1.4 would lie to DXVK = footgun; default-1.3 avoids it. All 4 Nightlies DXVK release bodies updated
with the VK1.4 note + "Current version: 3.0". Driver side: The412Banner/Banners-Turnip builds report
**Vulkan 1.4.354** (Mesa main, `TU_API_VERSION=VK_MAKE_VERSION(1,4,..)` for chip≥7); device Adreno 750 (A7xx)
gets the 1.4 path. DEVICE-UNTESTED end-to-end (DXVK 3.0 launch w/ 1.4 selected).

**SurfaceFlinger renderer (ASR) — Phase-0 spike (branch `feat/surfaceflinger-renderer`, commit `068c3a5`,
CI `28208898551`).** 3rd host renderer ported from GameNative PR #1582 (André Vito; built on StevenMX's
scanout work). Confirmed our `cpp/winlator/VulkanRendererScanout.cpp` is **byte-identical** to GameNative's —
Steven's scanout foundation already in-tree. Spike = compiles + selectable (NOT a working compositor):
native `cpp/asurfacerenderer/` (JNI repackaged to `com_winlator_star_renderer`) → `libasurface_renderer.so`
via main CMakeLists; skeleton `ASurfaceRenderer` implements `HostRenderer` + loads lib + creates/destroys the
SF context on the surface lifecycle (per-window scene compositing deferred to Phase 1); selection wired in
`XServerView.initRenderer(String)` + `XServerDisplayActivity` (API<29 → Vulkan fallback) + "SurfaceFlinger"
added to container + per-game renderer dropdowns. NOT merged; device-test pending. See
`reference_gamenative_surfaceflinger_renderer` memory for the full Phase-1 plan.

## 2026-06-25 — 1.8 STABLE cut ✅ (updater picker fix + in-app OTA proven on a real stable)

Closed out the 1.8 cycle. One code blocker remained from the updater work, then cut stable.

**Picker correctness fix (`f1729a7`, branch `fix/updater-picker-sort`, CI `28200393133` ✅ → ff-merged to
main, branch deleted).** GitHub's list-releases API does **not** return pure newest-first — it pins the
`make_latest` release to the top, then lists the rest by date. Confirmed live: the API returned
`[1.7 (latest, published 01:46), 1.8-pre2 (published 20:30), 1.8-pre1, 1.6…]`. `UpdateManager.pickNewestWithUpdateJson`
took the **first** array element carrying `update.json`, which worked only because 1.7 had none (skipped).
Once 1.8 stable carried `update.json` + `make_latest`, it would have **shadowed a newer 1.9-preN** in the
prerelease channel. Fix = parse all releases into a list, `sortWith(compareByDescending { optString("published_at","") })`
(ISO-8601 sorts lexicographically = chronologically), then walk for the first with `update.json`.

**1.8 stable cut (user explicit go-ahead — required by the hard rule).** Bumped `versionCode 27→28` +
`versionName "1.8"` (`376e5fd`), dispatched `release.yml` with `release_tag=1.8 release_number=1.8
make_prerelease=false` → workflow auto-sets `prerelease:false` + `make_latest:true`. Release run
`28201699881` ✅. Verified: **Bannerlator 1.8 = Latest**, 1.7 demoted; assets = 3 flavor APKs +
`update.json`; **`releases/latest/download/update.json` now resolves to vc28/1.8** (stable updater
baseline live). Release body rewritten to match the 1.7 layout (logo / tagline / What's-New sections /
downloads table / credits / collapsible changelog) — intentionally **no reinstall-imageFS warning** since
1.8 is app-side only (HUD + updater), nothing changed in imageFS.

**✅ In-app OTA proven on a real stable cut:** a device running **1.8-pre2 (vc27)** auto-updated in-app to
**1.8 stable (vc28)** — the full updater loop (detect → download correct flavor → install) confirmed on a
genuine stable transition, not just pre→pre. Main tip `376e5fd`.

**1.8 ships:** GameHub-style perf HUD (2nd selectable overlay + live swap) · in-app updater (auto-install
+ optional prerelease channel) · setup-screen branding fix · updater picker fix. Next cycle → 1.9-preN
prereleases until an explicit stable call.

---

## 2026-06-25 (later) — In-app updater + prerelease channel (✅ device-proven, shipping via 1.8-preN)

Built a GitHub-releases-based **in-app update system** (modelled on the BannersComponentInjector /
BannerHub updater). Merged to main; being device-tested via prereleases.

**Core — `core/UpdateManager.kt`:** fetches `releases/latest/download/update.json`, compares
`BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE` (the integer is the source of truth, NOT the tag string), caches to
`cacheDir` (offline-safe), picks the flavor APK by `BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID`, downloads via the
existing `HttpUtils` (reuses `DownloadProgressDialog`) and installs through the existing
`com.winlator.star.tileprovider` FileProvider. Install-permission guarded (`REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`,
Android 8+). **UI lives in 3 places:** Settings → new "Updates" section (readout, Check, Download &
install, Notify toggle); About dialog (latest-version line + "Update now"); app-wide amber home banner
(honours notify + skip-version). Manifest got `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` + an `external-cache-path`;
`release.yml` generates + attaches `update.json` per release.

**"Include pre-releases" toggle (Settings, default OFF):** OFF = stable path (`releases/latest` only ever
resolves to a non-prerelease). ON = `checkViaApi` → GitHub releases API (`?per_page=30`, prereleases
included) → newest release carrying an `update.json` → its own asset URLs. **Gotcha: api.github.com 403s
without a `User-Agent`** → added one to `HttpUtils`' string fetch. `release.yml` gained a
`make_prerelease` input (sets `prerelease` + inverts `make_latest`); `update.json` now attaches to EVERY
release so the toggle has data.

**Versioning rule established (hard rule):** stables = plain numeric tag (`1.8`,`1.9`),
`prerelease:false` + `make_latest:true` — the ONLY thing the default updater offers. Everything between
stables = `X.Y-preN` (`1.9-pre1`,`pre2`…), `prerelease:true`, no make_latest, until explicitly promoted.
`versionCode` ticks up on EVERY build.

**Branding fix (`fix/setup-splash-branding`, merged):** the shared `DownloadProgressDialog` (first-launch
imagefs setup + HttpUtils downloads incl. the update download) hardcoded **"Star Bionic"** + **"Bionic
V1.1"** — caught from a device screenshot (pulled via root bridge). Title → `@string/app_name`
(per-flavor), version → `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME` (dynamic, new `@+id/TVVersion`). Also cleaned the
leftover "Star Bionic" in the unused `about_dialog.xml`.

**Build log:**

| Step | Commit / Tag | CI Run | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Updater core (Settings/About/banner) | `41d7c06` | `28193511129` | ✅ green |
| Include-prereleases toggle + UA fix | `19b7e36` | `28195066124` | ✅ green |
| Merge + bump → 1.8-pre1 (vc26) | `ca87892` | `28195824422` (release) | ✅ published (prerelease) |
| Setup-screen branding fix | `b11814c` | `28197124387` | ✅ green |
| Merge + bump → 1.8-pre2 (vc27) | `2b10f53` | `28197773910` (release) | ✅ published (prerelease) |

**✅ DEVICE-PROVEN:** on the installed vc25 build, toggling Include-prereleases ON surfaced 1.8-pre1, and
Update downloaded + installed + launched it end-to-end. 1.8-pre2 (vc27) cut to re-test + carry the
branding fix. Stable 1.7 users untouched throughout (`releases/latest` still 404s for update.json since
1.7 predates the feature; no pre is make_latest). Main tip `2b10f53`.

**🐛 KNOWN latent bug (NOT yet fixed):** GitHub `/releases` API is not reliably newest-first — it hoists
the `make_latest` (stable) release to the top. `pickNewestWithUpdateJson` takes the first array element
with an `update.json`, which works while only prereleases carry it, but once a **stable + a newer
prerelease coexist**, the older stable would win over the newer beta for toggle-on users. **Fix before
cutting 1.8 stable: sort releases by `published_at` (fallback `created_at`) DESC before scanning.**

## 2026-06-25 — GameHub HUD: device-test crash fix + full in-game drawer mirror (branch `feat/gamehub-perf-hud`)

Continued the GameHub HUD port from P0–P4 (entry below) into on-device testing. Two follow-ups, neither merged.

**1. First-launch crash FIXED (`4808d51`, build `28179250039` ✅ green).** Installing the correct P4
build and enabling the GameHub HUD crashed the container + app the moment the overlay first refreshed.
Logcat (pulled via the root bridge):
```
FATAL EXCEPTION: Thread-6
android.view.ViewRootImpl$CalledFromWrongThreadException: Only the original thread that
  created a view hierarchy can touch its views. Expected: main Calling: Thread-6
    at com.winlator.star.widget.PerfHudView.update(PerfHudView.java:350)
    at ...XServerDisplayActivity$6.onUpdateWindowContent(:798)   ← X-server epoll thread (PresentExtension)
```
Root cause: `PerfHudView.update()` runs on the X-server epoll thread and called `requestLayout()` /
`invalidate()` directly — neither is thread-safe. `FrameRating` never hit this because it marshals via
`post(this)`. Fix = `post(refreshOnUi)` where `refreshOnUi = () -> { requestLayout(); invalidate(); }`.
The other two view-touching methods (`applyConfig`, `setVertical`) already run on the UI thread
(`runOnUiThread` at `XServerDisplayActivity:561` / tap handler). **Gotcha for future HUD work: anything
reached from `onUpdateWindowContent` is on the epoll thread → only `post()` / `postInvalidate()`.**

**2. In-game side drawer now fully mirrors the container dialog (`7437c3d`).** User wanted the same
settings/toggles in the in-game HUD tab. Before, `XServerDrawer.kt` → `HudContent` only had the classic
subset (scale/opacity + 6 toggles) and its `buildConfig()` **omitted `hudStyle` and every gamehub-only
key** — so changing anything in-game while the GameHub HUD was active stripped `hudStyle=gamehub` from the
saved container config (persisted via `onFpsConfigApply` → `setFPSCounterConfig` + `saveData` at
`XServerDisplayActivity:567`), reverting to the classic HUD on next launch. Rewrote `HudContent` to mirror
`FpsCounterConfigDialog` exactly: GameHub-style switch, FPS-graph / Power / GPU-model / dual-battery
toggles, skin/color/outline 3-stop chips (new drawer-styled `HudChipRow`, no FilterChip import), opacity
slider, and the **identical key set** (emits both classic + gamehub metric key names) so the drawer and
the pre-launch dialog are interchangeable. Metric/skin/scale/opacity changes apply **live** via
`onFpsConfigApply` → `perfHud.applyConfig` (UI-thread safe). The classic↔gamehub **view swap** still
applies on next launch only (the view is chosen at launch; a caption notes this) — live view-swap is a
possible follow-up.

Branch tip `7437c3d`. Combined build CI `28181338752` (in progress at time of writing). **NOT merged.**
Next: device-test the `28181338752` build — (a) enable GameHub HUD (master **Show FPS** must also be on),
launch → confirm renders without crash + tap flips orientation + metrics live; (b) open in-game drawer
HUD tab → confirm all GameHub controls present, apply live, and no revert-to-classic → tune dims/colors →
merge to main.

## 2026-06-25 — GameHub-style performance HUD port (branch `feat/gamehub-perf-hud`) — P0–P4 coded, device-test pending

A second, **selectable** in-game performance HUD modeled on GameHub 6.0.9's overlay, alongside the
existing `FrameRating`. User scope: **full parity** (17 controls), **per-container**, **all 3 skins**.
Clean reimplementation (our own View + data we already collect) — no GameHub code/assets copied.

Recon: 3 Explore agents over the jadx decompile (`/home/claude-user/gamehub-6.0.9-jadx`, GameHub =
Compose-Multiplatform `com.xiaoji.egggame`, obfuscated). HUD = plain Canvas/Paint/Path (no Compose/GL/
native for visuals; ref legacy View `o6m.java`). Two layouts (horizontal pill / vertical list), FPS line
graph (last 50 samples, peak clamped ≥60, 30fps guide), Classic/Neon/Mono skins, color-intensity
(0.72/0.88/1.0), text outline (off/1.0dp/1.4dp), scale 0.6–1.4, opacity. Most metrics already collected
by `FrameRating`; FPS comes from our own frame counter (GameHub's `libxserver.so` shm not needed).

- **P0 plan** `docs/GAMEHUB_PERF_HUD_PORT_PLAN.md`.
- **P1+P2** new `widget/PerfHudView.java` — self-contained Canvas view: both layouts, per-field colors,
  FPS graph, all 3 skins, color-intensity, outline, scale, opacity; parses the `fpsCounterConfig`
  KeyValueSet; `update()` frame-tick mirrors `FrameRating`; tap-toggle + drag. Standalone compile CI
  `28175068799` ✅ green.
- **P3** new `widget/HudMetrics.java` — shared collector: GPU% / temp / RAM / power+charging ported from
  `FrameRating`, **plus** overall CPU usage % (`/proc/stat` delta) and the dual-battery power fix (sums
  `battery`+`bms`+`main` `current_now` with abs()).
- **P0 wiring** `XServerDisplayActivity.java` — when `hudStyle=gamehub`, creates a `PerfHudView`
  (WRAP_CONTENT params) instead of the two `FrameRating` views; handled at every HUD site (create /
  show-hide / frame-tick update / live applyConfig / `toggleFpsHudOrientation`→`perfHud.setVertical` /
  DX-API detect→`setEngineLabel` / `_MESA_DRV_GPU_NAME`→`setGpuModel`). Classic path unchanged.
- **P4 config UI** `ContainerDetailScreen.kt` `FpsCounterConfigDialog` — "GameHub-style HUD" switch
  (`hudStyle`) + 9 metric toggles + dual-battery + scale/opacity sliders + skin/color/outline 3-stop
  FilterChip selectors (`HudToggleRow`/`HudThreeStop`); toggles emitted under both classic + gamehub key
  names; bounded scroll via `heightIn(screenHeight*0.7)`.

Config keys (per-container `fpsCounterConfig`): `hudStyle=classic|gamehub`, `hudMode`, `showFPS`,
`showFPSGraph`, `showCPUUsage`(+`showCPULoad`), `showGPULoad`, `showRAM`, `showPower`,
`showTemp`(+`showBatteryTemp`), `showEngine`(+`showRenderer`), `showGpuModel`, `hudDualBattery`,
`hudSkin=classic|neon|mono`, `hudColor=soft|mid|vivid`, `hudOutline=off|soft|strong`, `hudScale` (50–150),
`hudOpacity` (0–100), `hudTransparency` (classic).

Branch tip `b2fc55e`. Full artifact build CI `28176206476` (in progress at time of writing). **NOT merged.**
Next: verify build green → device-test (enable "GameHub-style HUD" in a container's FPS settings, launch,
confirm render + tap-flip + live metrics) → tune dimensions/colors on device → merge to main. Caveats:
HUD dimensions are first-guess; CPU% is overall-device (not per-game); in-game `XServerDrawer.kt` config
not extended (container-detail dialog only; orientation tap still works in-game).

## 2026-06-25 — Two HUD fixes merged to main (`ac6abbb`)

- **Fake FPS offset removed** (`19c9982`): stripped a fudge offset from `FrameRating.java` +
  `FrameRatingHorizontal.java` so the on-screen FPS reads true when native rendering is on.
- **Vertical HUD tap area fixed** (`ac6abbb`): the vertical `FrameRating` was added to the root
  `FrameLayout` with no LayoutParams, inheriting FrameLayout's `MATCH_PARENT × MATCH_PARENT` default — so
  its tap-to-toggle hit area covered the whole screen (a tap far from the overlay flipped orientation).
  Fixed with explicit `WRAP_CONTENT` + top-left gravity. Both built green (`28172970834`) and
  fast-forward-merged to main; `fix/fps-hud-tap-area` deleted. No release cut (still versionCode 25).

## 2026-06-24 — Steam detail-page revamp — branch `feat/steam-detail-revamp` (stacked on launch branch)

User asked to modernize the Steam game detail page. Picked all of: stored-info rows, last-played,
real playtime hours, bigger sheets (DLC/branch/cloud/add-home), and more robust/fluid download buttons +
accurate progress bars.

- **Chunk 1 DONE** (`SteamGameDetailActivity.kt` `ca90b96`): renders **developer / genres /
  metacritic** (already stored in our GameRow but previously hidden) + a **"Last played"** row from the
  install-dir timestamp (`relativeTime()`); reworked the downloads UI — **animated rounded progress bar**
  in a card with an **indeterminate "Preparing…" phase** and a separate %/bytes line; new
  `DetailActionButton` (48dp, rounded, disabled dimming) + `DetailInfoRow`. Pure UI/Compose.
- **Chunk 2 — real playtime hours: ABANDONED + REVERTED** (`ee85bf9`). Tried owned-games via JavaSteam
  unified messages (`SteamOwnedGames.kt`) but the API fought compilation (needed protobuf-java for the
  proto `GeneratedMessage` supertype; then `Player.getOwnedGames` return type is neither `Future` nor
  `CompletionStage` — `.get()`/`.toCompletableFuture()`/`.result`/`.body` unresolved). User chose to drop
  playtime recording; timestamp-based "Last played" (chunk 1) stays. Removed the file + Playtime row +
  protobuf-java dep.
- **TODO (remaining follow-up):** **bigger sheets** — DLC/depot manager, beta branch picker,
  cloud-save export/import/sync, add-to-home-screen (port from ref4ik `SteamLibrarySheets.kt` /
  `SteamGameActions.kt`).

**RESUME SNAPSHOT (2026-06-24, for crash recovery):** Two stacked feature branches, NONE merged, all
device-test-pending:
  • `feat/steam-pluvia-launch` (off main) — Pluvia Phase 1 coldclient launch, steps 1-4, commits
    `ff13265`/`1c6839d`/`f0b6106`/`73834d6`, all compile-green. Drawer "Steam" = unchanged store; adds
    emulation launch.
  • `feat/steam-detail-revamp` (stacked on the launch branch) — tip `ee85bf9` — detail revamp chunk 1
    only (chunk-2 playtime reverted). CI `28143904501`.
NEXT WHEN RESUMING: (1) confirm CI `28143904501` green; (2) device-test on the test device — Steam
download → add a steam_api game with "Steam emulation" → confirm Goldberg launch; detail page shows
dev/genres/metacritic/last-played + fluid progress; (3) optionally build the bigger sheets;
(4) then decide merge order (launch branch → main first, then rebase revamp → main). ref4ik clone at
`/home/claude-user/scratchpad/ref4ik`. Full design = `docs/STEAM_PLUVIA_PORT_PLAN.md`.

**imageFS reinstall?** No — for the Steam coldclient + detail revamp, updating 1.7 → next release needs
NO imageFS reinstall. The coldclient loader is a separate bundled APK asset extracted at runtime into the
existing imageFS (not baked into `imagefs.txz`), and the detail revamp is app-only. (Only carryover: if a
user never reinstalled imageFS for 1.7's ffmpeg-8, that 1.7 recommendation still applies.)

## 2026-06-24 — Pluvia Steam: Phase 1 (Goldberg/coldclient launch) — branch `feat/steam-pluvia-launch`

Implementing the recommended **Option A** from `docs/STEAM_PLUVIA_PORT_PLAN.md` — **UPGRADE the
existing Steam store** (browse/login/download/UI stay ours, unchanged from 1.7), adding only the
Goldberg/coldclient **launch** so SteamAPI titles actually run. ⚠️ User confirmed scope 2026-06-24:
NOT a full replacement (drawer "Steam" still opens our existing store). All work on the branch; NOT
merged; device-test pending.

- **Step 1 (`ff13265`)** — bundled asset `experimental-drm.tzst` (coldclient loader x32/x64 +
  emulated steamclient DLLs + extra_dlls; PE → host-arch independent) + `SteamClientManager.kt`
  (extracts it into the imageFs Steam dir). Ported from REF4IK/winlator-ref4ik- (GPL-3.0).
- **Step 2 (`1c6839d`)** — `SteamLaunchUtils.kt`: self-contained **offline** Goldberg helpers
  (writeColdClientIni, generateInterfacesFile, writeOfflineSteamSettings, backupSteamclientFiles,
  putBackSteamDlls, setupLightweightSteamConfig, skipFirstTimeSteamSetup, ensureSteamappsCommonSymlink).
  No dependency on ref4ik's Room SteamService; account read from our `steam_prefs`.
- **Step 3 (`f0b6106`)** — launch glue: `prepareColdClientLaunch` + `writeGameSteamSettings` +
  `StarLaunchBridge.addSteamGameToLauncher`/`writeSteamShortcut` (container picker → activateContainer →
  prepare env → write `.desktop` `Exec=wine C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamclient_loader_x64.exe`
  with `game_source=STEAM` Extra Data). Prefix model = `activateContainer` repoints the `home/xuser`
  symlink → active container; corrected ref4ik's `skipFirstTimeSteamSetup` to take `imageFs.rootDir`.
- **Step 4 (`73834d6`)** — Compose UI: `SteamGameDetailActivity` shows a Compose AlertDialog
  ("Steam emulation" vs "Run .exe directly") after exe resolution → routes to the coldclient path or
  legacy raw path; `SteamGamesActivity` defaults its add paths to the emulation route.

Compile CIs: steps 1+2 `28141425805` ✅ green; steps 3 `28141874404` / 4 `28142049412` ⏳ pending.
**Next:** device-test a steam_api title (download → add with Steam emulation → boots under Goldberg)
→ then merge to main. Possible follow-ups: preferred-container, PICS LaunchInfo exe detection, cloud saves.

## 2026-06-24 — 🚀 Release 1.7

Cut **Bannerlator 1.7** (`versionName 1.7`, `versionCode 25`, commit `30c869c`). Version bumped in
`app/build.gradle`; splash screen reads `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME` so it shows "V 1.7" automatically
(no hardcoded version strings anywhere). README version line + "What's New in 1.7" updated (1.6 notes
demoted to "Previously in 1.6"). Release build = workflow "Nightly Manual Release Build" run
`28140854161` (tag `1.7`, builds standard/ludashi/pubg release APKs) — ✅ GREEN. **PUBLISHED**
https://github.com/The412Banner/Bannerlator/releases/tag/1.7 with full notes; 3 assets each ~588.7 MB
(`Bannerlator-1.7-standard.apk` 588704729 B / `-ludashi.apk` 588704765 B / `-pubg.apk` 588704647 B).
Everything merged to main since the 1.6 tag is in this release:

- **Steam store — downloads fixed**: login-race guard (`9f6197e`) + BouncyCastle SHA-1 provider
  registration (`63e4366`). ⚠️ download-only; raw `wine exe` launch still has no steam-emu (DRM games
  may not run — see `docs/STEAM_PLUVIA_PORT_PLAN.md`).
- **Components installer (new)**: in-container Wine-dependency installer (Phase 2 file-drop + Phase 3b
  execute engine), copy_dll glob + arch-targeting fixes, win7/winXP set_windows, persisted Installed
  status.
- **On-screen controls**: overlay-opacity slider moved to in-game side menu, live, true 0–100 %.
- **FPS overlay**: tap to toggle orientation, live D3D API label (VKD3D vs DXVK).
- **Vulkan**: Advanced Vulkan / Graphics Driver dialogs scrollable.
- **Video**: full ffmpeg-8 libs bundled for winedmo.

⚠️ DEVICE-TEST status: Steam download fix, Components installer, and overlay-opacity were CI-green but
device-test was still pending/partial at release time.

## 2026-06-24 (late 2) — Steam download fixes + Pluvia/GameNative Steam-store recon & plan

**Steam download bug (✅ MERGED to main `63e4366`/`9f6197e`; compile CI `28139917719` ✅ green;
device-test pending).** User's Steam game downloads failed "Download failed: Unknown error".
Two distinct bugs found from the on-device `steam_debug.txt`:
1. *Login race* — `runInstall` started while `connected=true` but `loggedIn=false` (Steam CM
   connections cycle; re-logon after reconnect is async, license cache masked it). Manifest job
   timed out → `CancellationException`. Fix = new `SteamRepository.ensureLoggedIn(timeoutMs)` guard
   in `runInstall` (re-logon from saved token, wait up to 15s).
2. *SHA-1/BC* (the real download-killer, seen after re-login) — JavaSteam `DepotManifest.serialize`
   calls `MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-1","BC")`; Android's built-in "BC" provider has SHA-1
   stripped → `NoSuchAlgorithmException`. App bundled `bcprov-jdk15on` but never registered it.
   Fix = static initializer in `SteamRepository` that removes stock BC + installs the full
   `BouncyCastleProvider`. Device-test of FlatOut 2 pending; then merge to main.

**Recon + plan: "Pluvia Steam" to replace the current Steam store.** Researched GameNative
(utkarshdalal/GameNative, GPL-3.0; local at `/home/claude-user/GameNative/`) and Pluvia
(oxters168/Pluvia, original, stalled). Key finding: **REF4IK/winlator-ref4ik-** (`com.winlator.cmod`)
already ported the GameNative/Pluvia Steam module into a Winlator **Cmod** fork — same lineage as
us — on the **same `in.dragonbra:javasteam:1.8.0`** we ship. It's an *upgrade*, not greenfield:
our download already works (post-fix); the real prize is the **Goldberg/coldclient launch model**
(ref4ik `SteamGameLauncher.kt`) — our store launches raw `wine exe`, so DRM/steam_api titles fail.
Recommendation = **Option A incremental** (Phase 1: Goldberg launch + loader assets +
`game_source`/`app_id` shortcut extras; then preferred-container, PICS LaunchInfo exe detection,
optional cloud-saves/updates). Full file-level seam map + risks (GPL-3.0, Goldberg asset arch,
bionic = coldclient only, A:↔Z: drive, Room↔SQLite) → **`docs/STEAM_PLUVIA_PORT_PLAN.md`** (this
commit). NOT STARTED — for down the road.

## 2026-06-24 (late) — Merged the day's branches to main + new Components installer fix

Rolled the day's feature branches onto `main` (linear rebase/ff, branches deleted). `main` tip now
`0ea1a84`. The 10 commits that make up today (oldest→newest):

1. `445f963` Components Phase 3b — execute engine for installer-based components (.NET/vcredist)
2. `1955f43` Components Phase 3b — auto-close installer sessions + cleanup
3. `c4399ce` Components — install win7/winXP via pure `set_windows` instead of N/A
4. `ce6561d` imagefs — bundle full ffmpeg-8 libs for winedmo video decode *(was the leftover "PENDING #2")*
5. `fe8e74d` HUD — live D3D API label (VKD3D vs DXVK) + tap overlay to toggle FPS orientation
6. `19ec967` HUD — tap overlay to toggle orientation live; dropped the settings dropdown
7. `de71493` Vulkan — make Advanced Vulkan / Graphics Driver dialogs scrollable
8. `16dc463` docs — components N/A backfill + quartz device-test (this log)
9. `4b9b0ad` Controls — overlay-opacity slider moved into in-game side menu (live, true 0–100 %)
10. `0ea1a84` **Components fix (new today)** — see below

**`0ea1a84` Components installer — two bugs fixed** (branch `fix/components-copy-and-installed-persist`,
rebased+ff to main, deleted; CI `28137352729` ✅ green; **device-untested**):
- **`copy_dll` glob was broken.** `copyMatching` built its regex as
  `Regex.escape(pattern).replace("\\*",".*")`, but Kotlin's `Regex.escape` uses `Pattern.quote`
  (`\Q…\E`), so a literal `"*"` file_name pattern compiled to `^\Q*\E$` — matching a file *named* `*`
  (nothing). The `*` components (`atmlib`/`devenum` + the pre-baked win7-SP1 set) set their DLL
  override but **never copied the DLL**. Fix: `pattern.split("*").joinToString(".*"){Regex.escape(it)}`
  → proper glob semantics. (`ComponentInstaller.kt`)
- **"Installed" status didn't persist.** It lived in an in-memory `remember{}` set, so it reset on
  every sheet close/reopen. Now persisted per container in SharedPreferences `component_installs`
  (key `c<id>`): loaded on open, written on each successful install. (`ComponentsSheet.kt`)

**Main artifact build:** triggered run **`28138274652`** (CI Build, artifacts only, `main`).
**Next:** device-test the glob fix + persisted-installed status (root bridge) → then cut 1.6.

## 2026-06-24 — Components: backfilled 15 "N/A" components + device-tested registration

**Backfill (winlator-contents `1f6eb72`).** The catalog had **17 components stuck at N/A**
(`needs-upstream`/`pending-manual`) because their source files were never mirrored. User supplied
the missing Microsoft files (`windows6.1-kb976932` Win7-SP1 x64+x86, ~1.5 GB; `powershell-wrapper.zip`),
covering **15 of 17**.

- The app has **no runtime cab engine** (verified: `ComponentInstaller`/`ComponentExecInstaller`
  handle neither `cab_extract`/`get_from_cab` nor `register_dll`; Phase 3b = installer-exec, not cab).
  The 12 already-working cab components were **pre-baked build-side** — so I followed the same method.
- **Pre-baked** the DLLs with `cabextract` straight out of the SP1 packages (all validated PE/`MZ`),
  packaged each as `<name>__libs.tar.xz` (`win32/`+`win64/` layout, gdiplus = 1.1.7601.17514),
  uploaded all **15** to release `system-libraries-v1` (~10 MB total — not the 1.5 GB raw `.exe`s,
  which would never install).
- **Rewrote** each component in `components.json` to the proven file-drop pattern
  (`archive_extract` + `copy_dll`(+`override_dll`)) — exactly like `devenum`/`riched20`; dropped the
  unsupported `register_dll` (native override inherits Wine's builtin COM registration). PowerShell
  repackaged into the same convention (its `powershell_core` dep was already `ready`).
- Catalog tally now **ready 112 / N/A 2**. Still N/A: `art2k7min` (needs AccessRuntime2007.exe),
  `vbrun6` (needs VB6 SP6 runtime).
- **No app rebuild needed:** `ComponentCatalog` fetches the catalog live (no cache) from
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/components.json`; installed builds see the 15 within minutes.

**Device test — quartz registration CONFIRMED (root bridge, `com.winlator.banner`).** Premise held:
every container prefix already has builtin Wine quartz fully COM-registered (**48** `quartz.dll`
InprocServer32 refs, FilterGraph CLSID `{e436ebb3-…}` + DirectShow Filters category present). Did a
reversible end-to-end install on `xuser-2` "P11 ARM" (backups `*.bak-comp`): native MS `quartz.dll`
→ system32 (1,572,352 B) + syswow64 (1,328,128 B), both `MZ`; inserted `"quartz"="native,builtin"`;
**48 CLSIDs still resolve to quartz.dll (now the native DLL), FilterGraph CLSID intact**. Only the
runtime-load under Wine/arm64ec (launch a DirectShow/FMV title) is left for a user-side check.

## 2026-06-24 — In-game overlay-opacity (controls) reworked + moved to side menu

On-screen controls "overlay opacity not working" → fixed + relocated. Was: draw curve
`0.5+0.7*opacity` (dead top ~29 %, never faint), `setOverlayOpacity()` never `invalidate()`d, editor
hardcoded 0.6. Now **linear 0–100 %** (0 % = fully invisible; accent-stroke alpha floors scaled with
opacity), live `invalidate()`, and the slider **moved from the Input-Controls profile screen into the
in-game side menu (Controls tab)** so it tunes the visible overlay live (`XServerDrawerState`
`overlayOpacity` + `onOverlayOpacityChange`; activity applies + persists). DEFAULT 0.4→0.75 (matches
old look under the new mapping). Branch `feat/ingame-overlay-opacity` `d3f2a8b`, compile CI
`28135045851` ✅ green. Next: device-test → merge for the next release.

## 2026-06-23 — Components installer: catalog + mirror DONE (app side next)

Building a **Components installer** for container settings — browse + install Wine dependencies
(mono, gecko, dotnet, vcredist, d3dx, …) into a container's prefix, the same set BannerHub/GameHub
offer (Bottles "Type 6 — System Libraries", 114 components).

- **Mirrored** all components' binaries to a new release **`system-libraries-v1`** on
  `The412Banner/winlator-contents` — **92 assets**, deduped by URL (shared payloads like the Win7-SP1
  packages referenced once, not per-component). Each asset named after its component.
- **6 not mirrored** (manual re-source list at `/sdcard/Download/winlator-components-needed.txt`):
  the 3 huge **Win7-SP1 platform-update** packages (shared by 14 components → referenced upstream) and
  3 dead/timed-out sources (`art2k7min`, `powershell`, `vbrun6`).
- **`components.json` committed + live** on winlator-contents
  (`raw.githubusercontent.com/The412Banner/winlator-contents/main/components.json`) — 114 components
  with full **Bottles-format install steps**, URLs rewritten to the mirror; `status` per component:
  **ready 97 / needs-upstream 14 / pending-manual 3**.
- **App side: Phase 2 + Phase 3a DONE & MERGED to main** (`4c732b8`, build `28072511822`).
  - **Phase 2** (`91ca6a3`): a "Components" browser in the Win Components tab (`ComponentsSheet`) +
    `ComponentCatalog` (reads the live components.json) + `ComponentInstaller` (file-drop Bottles
    steps → `system32`/`syswow64` + DLL overrides via `WineRegistryEditor`). **Device + root-verified:**
    installed `d3dcompiler_43`/`_47` — correct 64-bit→system32 / 32-bit→syswow64 + overrides set.
  - **Copy hardening** (`4c732b8`): `copy_dll` constrains source to the matching arch sub-tree.
  - **Phase 3a (pre-bake, no app change):** extracted the cab contents build-side with `cabextract`,
    hosted 12 components as `<name>__libs.tar.xz` on the `system-libraries-v1` release, and rewrote
    their catalog steps to file-drop. **22 components now installable** (10 file-drop + 12 pre-baked
    cab: d3dcompiler_42/46, xinput, xaudio2.7, msxml6, atmlib, riched20, vcredist6, winhttp, …).
  - The app reads components.json at runtime, so catalog updates are live without an app rebuild.
- **Still to do — Phase 3b:** the execute engine (`install_exe`/`install_msi` via launching the
  container session) for the +54 .NET / vcredist runtimes. Plan in memory `project_bannerlator_components_installer`.

## 1.6 RELEASE MANIFEST (in progress, since tag `1.5` / `dc74f67`) — NOT yet released

Everything queued for the next release:

**Merged to `main`** (device-confirmed):
1. On-screen dpad/stick multi-touch freeze fix (`fba6080`, merged `d1356d8`) — GitHub issue #5, reporter-confirmed.
2. In-app File Manager batch (`d086990`→`5521e0f`, +`ca26466`) — data-loss paste, silent Run, working dir, off-thread listing, copy-into-self guard, copy progress bar, PTR/scroll/file+exe icons, system-Back-up-one-dir, Run-executes-exe-in-container (`core/WinePath.kt`).
3. Per-game (shortcut) overrides for Renderer + Frame-Gen engine + FPS limiter (`08878be`).
4. Frame gen starts OFF in-game on every launch (`a669b8b`).

5. Standalone FPS limiter — guest-side X11 Present IdleNotify pacing (`bd990b2`) + lsfg≥2 guard (`4909549`); caps fps with Off / bionic-fg / lsfg-vk, both host renderers, live. ✅ merged to main (`a2ebd35`), GameNative credit (`0eadf16`).
6. Advanced Vulkan present settings now actually apply (native/presentMode/filter/swapRB) + renderer-dropdown label/gear fix. ✅ merged to main (`dcd9d47`).

**In progress (before 1.6, user's call)** — branch `feat/layer-download-menu`:
7. Compatibility-layer download menu rework — adrenotools-style cards, cloud opens the sheet directly, install-from-file in the sheet, Wine/Proton chips, in-use marker, byte-accurate install bar. See the dated section below.

Next: finish the download menu → merge → cut 1.6 (bump versionCode from 23 + splash).

---

## 2026-06-23 — Compatibility-layer download menu rework (branch `feat/layer-download-menu`, in progress)

Reworked the per-component download entry points into an adrenotools-style menu. The backend
(`ContentDownloadSheet` + `ContentsManager` + one remote `contents.json`) already covered all five
layers — the work is front-end consolidation + a real install bar. Confirmed design (HTML preview
first, then implemented):

- **Cloud icons replace the gears** on every layer (Wine/Proton, DXVK, VKD3D, Box64/WOWBox64, FEXCore);
  the cloud opens the download sheet **directly**. "Install from file" moved **into** the sheet header.
- **Adrenotools-style rows** — flat rows, `Memory` icon, name + "In use"/"Installed"/desc subtitle,
  trailing `CloudDownload`; chips restyled to the adrenotools `SourceChip` look. **Wine/Proton chips**
  split the compatibility-layer sheet; the others are single-type.
- **In-use marker** for the container's current version (Wine/Box64/FEXCore). Author/size are NOT in
  the manifest (`ContentProfile` has only type/verName/verCode/desc) — would need a manifest extension
  or a HEAD request; deferred.
- **Two determinate 0→100 bars** — blue "Downloading" (byte-accurate) and green "Installing", now also
  **byte-accurate**: `TarCompressorUtils` got a `CountingInputStream` + `OnReadProgressListener` and an
  `extract(…, total, listener)` overload reporting `bytesRead/total` off the compressed stream
  (single-pass, denominator = downloaded .wcp size); `ContentsManager.extraContentFile` got a matching
  overload; the sheet feeds it monotonically (ignoring the brief XZ-probe before the ZSTD pass).

VEGAS and the adrenotools GPU-driver downloader are left untouched. Kept as a centered `Dialog` for now
(bottom-sheet vs centered to be decided on device). First impl device-tested ("looks good").

**Build status (2026-06-23):** UI restyle + cloud-direct + file-in-sheet + in-use = `f4e551e` (CI
`28056314348` ✅). Byte-accurate install bar = `f9485ef` (CI **`28057297317`** — final combined build).
**⏸️ Resume:** verify `28057297317` green → download standard APK → device-test (cloud opens sheet
directly, adrenotools cards, Wine/Proton chips, install-from-file, in-use marker, real install bar) →
decide bottom-sheet vs centered + whether to add author/size → merge to main → cut 1.6.

---

## 2026-06-23 — Standalone FPS limiter (guest-side IdleNotify pacing) DEVICE-CONFIRMED ✅

Commit `bd990b2`, branch `feat/standalone-fps-limiter`, CI `28043133606` ✅ green.

The reworked limiter — guest-side X11 Present `IdleNotify` pacing in `PresentExtension`
(GameNative/Ludashi-3.1 mechanism: delay IdleNotify → DXVK blocks waiting for a free
buffer → the GUEST throttles), decoupled from the frame-gen layers — **caps fps in all
three FG modes: Off / bionic-fg / lsfg-vk.** Engine-agnostic, all-API, live in-game toggle.
This succeeds where the earlier host-side nanosleep pacer (`f8d7598`) failed (that one only
dropped frames at the compositor; the guest ran full-speed).

**✅ Confirmed on BOTH host renderers** — all 3 modes (Off / bionic-fg / lsfg-vk) cap fps on
the OpenGL host renderer AND the Vulkan host renderer.

**lsfg-mult≥2 guard wired (commit `4909549`, CI `28046025979`).** `lsfgGovernsFps()` returns true
when engine=lsfg + FG enabled + multiplier≥2; `applyFpsLimit()` clamps to 0 in that case, and
`reapplyFpsLimit()` runs from the lsfg branch of `onBionicFgConfigChange` so the guard engages the
moment the multiplier crosses 2. Rationale: lsfg paces itself when multiplying — layering our
IdleNotify limiter on top double-paces the stream (clamps the panel to the limiter value, kills the
FG gain, wastes GPU). Unaffected: bionic-fg, Off, and lsfg at 1× still cap.
> ⚠️ **SUPPORT NOTE:** if users report "the FPS limiter doesn't work / no cap" on **lsfg-vk**, this
> guard is the intended cause — the limiter is deliberately disabled while lsfg-vk multiplies
> (mult≥2). Documented in-code at `lsfgGovernsFps()`. Not a bug.

Remaining: guard CI green → merge `feat/standalone-fps-limiter` → main for 1.6.

## 2026-06-22 — lsfg-vk live reload CONFIRMED ✅ + Off→passthrough fix + engine badge + Task-Manager-on-Vulkan bug (diagnosing)

Session driven by live device questions ("which FG engine is running right now?").

**1. lsfg-vk 3× + LIVE RELOAD confirmed working (supersedes the 2026-06-21 "no live reload" finding).**
Probed the running game (`DOOMBLADE.exe`) on device: `liblsfg-vk.so` mapped into the game proc, env
`ENABLE_LSFG=1` / `LSFG_PROCESS=bannerlator-lsfg` / `LSFG_CONFIG=…/home/xuser/.config/lsfg-vk/conf.toml`,
`Lossless.dll` present. Logcat showed `lsfg-vk: Rereading configuration, as it is no longer valid.` →
`Reloaded configuration … Multiplier: 3` → `lsfg-vk-framegen: Entering Device::Device` — i.e. the
mtime-watch → OUT_OF_DATE → swapchain-recreate reload mechanism (GameNative fork `.so`) DOES fire on our
DXVK→vkd3d→wrapper_icd→Turnip stack now. Panel present rate ~138–143 fps on a 144 Hz panel = base ~46 × 3.
DXVK HUD correctly shows the BASE rate (~46) because lsfg-vk inserts frames downstream of DXVK's counter
(HUD≠panel is expected, and is itself proof FG works). Two conf.toml files exist: live
`home/xuser/.config/lsfg-vk/conf.toml` (read by the layer) and a stale `home/xuser-1/.config/bionic-fg/conf.toml`
(ignored by lsfg; its `fps_limit` field isn't an lsfg option). Minor cleanup candidate.

**2. Off-bug found + fixed.** Installed APK (`7f7ffb5`) predated the Off fix (`80e238a`), so in-game "Off"
wrote `multiplier = 2` (`Math.max(2,0)`) → still 2× frame gen. `80e238a` writes `1` (true passthrough).
Built off-fix APK (run `27941385132`, label `1.3-lsfg-offfix`, ✅ green). PROVEN on device by live-editing
the running conf.toml `multiplier 2→1`: reload fired (`Rereading` → `Multiplier: 1`), FPS dropped to native
~21–27. So `multiplier=1` = genuine off.

**3. Engine badge in in-game FG drawer (commit `740e779`).** Per user, replaced the standalone
"Frame Generation (AI)" header with a title + engine badge row — `Frame Generation  [● bionic-fg]` (green
dot = layer running this session; swaps to `lsfg-vk`; "Off" when disabled). No double labeling (user picked
the "Engine badge" layout). Plumbed `XServerDrawerState.frameGenEngine` ← `container.getFrameGenEngine()`,
wired in `XServerDisplayActivity` next to the other FG drawer-state setters.

**4. Task Manager reports nothing on the Vulkan host renderer (SAME container works on OpenGL). Diagnosing.**
Game runs fine; `winhandler.exe` (the process-list backend) is alive; no app crash. The new off-fix build's
Task Manager refreshes on a render-independent 1s timer and STILL shows empty on Vulkan → ruled out the
UI-tick/copyArea theory. `setupTmCallbacks`/listener registration are NOT renderer-conditional in source, so
nothing intends to disable it on Vulkan. Added WinHandler diagnostic logging (commit `e75d1d4`, tag
`WinHandlerTM`): logs INIT handshake, each `listProcesses` send + sendPacket result, every received request
code, and `GET_PROCESS` replies. One Vulkan run with Task Manager open will split it: `GET_PROCESS` arriving
but UI empty → Compose/StateFlow update problem on Vulkan; no `recv` at all → guest not replying / INIT never
happened. NOT yet root-caused.

**Builds:** off-fix `27941385132` (`1.3-lsfg-offfix`) ✅; logging-only `27943043968` (`1.3-tmlog`) ✅;
combined `27943884565` (`1.3-tmlog-badge` = off-fix + WinHandler logging + engine badge) — in progress.
Branch `feature/lsfg-vk-engine` tip `740e779`, pushed, NOT merged.
**NEXT:** deliver combined APK to `/sdcard/Download` + arm `WinHandlerTM` logcat → user opens Task Manager on
Vulkan once → read logs to root-cause → fix → merge to main.

## 2026-06-21 (night) — lsfg-vk DEVICE TEST: works (2×) but live in-game reload does NOT on our stack ⏸️ RESUME

Installed the test APK (`Bannerlator-1.3-lsfg-vk-standard.apk`, testkey, updates over current), imported a
`Lossless.dll`, selected lsfg-vk in a container, launched DOOMBLADE.

- ✅ **lsfg-vk loads + runs on our Turnip/Proton stack** (GameNative fork `.so` `93fa20bb`). Log
  `/sdcard/Download/lsfgvk_ingame_test.txt`: `Loaded configuration for bannerlator-lsfg` / `Shaders extracted` /
  layers init / AHB + swapchain contexts. **2× frame gen confirmed** (DXVK 39.4 → overlay 78). Opt-in
  `ENABLE_LSFG` gate, conf.toml driving, and `LSFG_PROCESS=bannerlator-lsfg` all work.
- 🐞 **Bug found + fixed (commit `80e238a`):** the in-game "Off" = drawer multiplier 0 (frame-gen stays
  enabled), and the callback did `Math.max(2,0)=2` → forced 2× on Off. Fixed to `mult>=2 ? mult : 1`
  (passthrough). Only matters on relaunch though, because…
- ❌ **Live conf.toml reload does NOT fire on our stack (definitive).** Bypassed the app entirely: `sed`'d the
  running game's conf.toml to `multiplier=1`, confirmed mtime changed → **zero `Rereading configuration` lines,
  FPS stayed 2×** (capture fresh through 19:36, not a gap). Then a fullscreen toggle (swapchain recreate) →
  still no change. So GameNative's mechanism (layer returns `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR` on conf change → DXVK
  recreates swapchain → layer re-reads) is **not propagating through DXVK → vkd3d → wrapper_icd → Turnip**.

**Decision pending (A vs B):**
- **(A, recommended)** ship lsfg-vk as **launch-time** config: restore the per-container Multiplier + Flow
  control (was in `1997a55`, removed in `7f7ffb5`); in-game drawer hides/labels lsfg FG controls as
  "relaunch to apply"; bionic-fg keeps its working live in-game control.
- **(B)** deep-dive why OUT_OF_DATE doesn't recreate/reload here (instrument a debug layer; uncertain).

**Resume state:** branch `feature/lsfg-vk-engine` @ `80e238a` (pushed, NOT merged). Build works; engine
selector + gray-out + DLL picker + lsfg-vk 2× all functional. Only the lsfg live in-game tuning is the gap.

## 2026-06-21 (evening) — lsfg-vk as a SECOND, selectable frame-gen engine (recon → spike → integration → in-game live)

New feature on branch **`feature/lsfg-vk-engine`** (off `main`; NOT merged): add **lsfg-vk** (Lossless
Scaling FG, PancakeTAS lineage) alongside the existing **bionic-fg** so users pick the engine per
container. User supplies their own `Lossless.dll` (we bundle nothing proprietary).

**Recon (3-repo lineage):** lsfg-vk source = `FrankBarretta/lsfg-vk-android@b55b182` (Android AHB port);
built by `The412Banner/LLS` CI (NDK 27, `-DLSFGVK_ANDROID_WINE=ON`, 2-line color-fix patch). Ludashi-plus
itself has NO lsfg-vk (it dropped the feature). LLS run `25313482636` has a clean prebuilt artifact (NO
`libc++_shared` dep — the libc++ blocker was only the old dead APK `.so`).

**Device spike (✅ SUCCESS):** staged the LLS prebuilt `.so` + manifest + the user's `Lossless.dll` into a
container's imagefs, env `LSFG_LEGACY=1 LSFG_DLL_PATH=… LSFG_MULTIPLIER=2 BIONIC_FG_DISABLE=1`. After fixing
my guest-relative DLL path → full Android path (guest is NOT chrooted), **DOOMBLADE ran with lsfg-vk doing
2× frame gen** (DXVK 39.3 → overlay 79). DEFINITIVELY confirmed lsfg-vk (not bionic) via live `/proc/*/maps`:
`liblsfg-vk.so` mapped r-xp in the game procs, `libbionic_fg.so` mapped in zero. lsfg-vk = plain implicit
layer, NO wrapper-ICD hack needed (unlike bionic-fg). ⚠️ it HARD-EXITS (bricks the container) if it can't read
the DLL → the feature must gate on a valid DLL.

**In-game LIVE control (GameNative recon):** stock lsfg-vk reads config once. GameNative makes mult/flow apply
mid-game by rewriting `conf.toml` → their **forked layer** watches the file mtime in its present hook → returns
`VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR` → game recreates swapchain → layer re-reads config (the ~100ms "pause" the user sees
= that rebuild). NO SIGSTOP, no app-side swapchain call. So we **re-vendored GameNative's fork** (`.so` md5
`93fa20bb`, has the `Rereading configuration` mtime-watch) and drive via **conf.toml**, not `LSFG_LEGACY` env.

**Integration (commits `a8974d9`,`1b96cb4`,`1997a55`,`7f7ffb5`):**
- Layer staged opt-in: `assets/lsfg-vk/{liblsfg-vk.so,manifest}` + `ImageFsInstaller.installLsfgVkLayer()`;
  added `enable_environment ENABLE_LSFG=1` to the manifest so the on-by-default upstream layer can't brick
  other containers (loads only when a container selects lsfg-vk).
- Launch wiring (`XServerDisplayActivity`): engine==lsfg → `ENABLE_LSFG=1` + `LSFG_CONFIG=<home>/.config/lsfg-vk/conf.toml`
  + `LSFG_PROCESS=bannerlator-lsfg` + `writeLsfgConfig()` ([global].dll + [[game]] mult/flow/present=fifo),
  gated on the imported DLL existing; else bionic-fg path unchanged. Mutual exclusion = one engine's enable env.
- Data model (`Container`): `getFrameGenEngine/setFrameGenEngine/isLsfgEngine` ("off"/"bionic"/"lsfg"; default
  migrates legacy `frameGenEnabled`).
- UI: container FG control = engine selector ONLY (Off/bionic-fg/lsfg-vk); **lsfg-vk grayed out until a
  `Lossless.dll` is imported** (`LabeledDropdown` gained `disabledOptions`). DLL picker at the bottom of
  Settings (SAF → **copies into `filesDir/lsfg-vk/Lossless.dll`**, loads from the copy).
- **Unified in-game control:** the single in-game multiplier toggle + flow slider drive WHICHEVER engine the
  container runs — `onBionicFgConfigChange` branches to `writeLsfgConfig` for lsfg (live reload via the fork's
  mtime-watch); drawer activated for lsfg containers. No per-container mult/flow control.

**APK signing:** all builds now signed with the AOSP **testkey v1+v2+v3** (`keystore/testkey.p12`, commit
`e09ac71`) so releases/updates install over previous installs (one-time uninstall on first testkey build).

**Build:** test APK run `27920491173` @ `7f7ffb5` (label `lsfg-vk-ui-test3`) IN PROGRESS. ⚠️ Dispatch-race
gotcha hit again — verify `git ls-remote` tip == local before `gh workflow run`. **STILL UNVERIFIED ON DEVICE:**
GameNative fork `.so` loading on our Turnip stack + the live conf.toml reload mid-game (the test APK verifies).

## 2026-06-21 (later) — sticky sync-failure force-disable fix + new `.so` `9136405c` STAGED/SWAPPED

Found (via Jason's PR #6 `layer.cpp:1093` follow-up) that the runtime auto-disable wasn't sticky:
`noteFenceTimeout` stored the kill in `conf.enabled`, which the hot-reload path overwrites wholesale
(`st.conf = newConf`) — so any conf.toml touch (notably the in-game flow slider) silently re-armed
framegen on an ICD path already proven sync-incompatible. **Fix:** new sticky `SwapState::framegenForceDisabled`
that hot-reload never clears; QueuePresent gate honours it; clean re-attempt point stays a swapchain
recreate. Fork `The412Banner/bionic-fg`@`bannerlator-android-wrapper-icd-fixes` commit `c861d8c`
(4th unpushed commit ahead of PR remote `ac2f5c0`). App branch `feature/bionic-fg-pr-followups`
`6807e83` (patch regen 597→608L, applies clean).

**Build gotcha logged:** first dispatch (run 27916226393) checked out the STALE tip `56c6735`
(dispatched a beat too fast after push → byte-identical `4b99b2d1`, no change). Re-dispatched
27916284710 on confirmed remote tip `6807e83` → **new `.so` md5 `9136405c`**, `will NOT re-enable`
log string confirmed compiled in. RULE: after `git push`, verify `git ls-remote` tip == local before
`gh workflow run`, or the run may use the old ref.

**Hot-swapped onto device** (no reinstall — pure layer-internal change, no conf/JNI/ABI surface):
`imagefs/usr/lib/libbionic_fg.so` 4b99b2d1→`9136405c` (owner u0_a484, chmod 600); backups `.bak_c8e4`
(shipped) + `.bak_prev` (4b99b2d1). App force-stopped. Staged `/sdcard/Download/libbionic_fg_9136405c.so`.

⚠️ **Test scope:** the sticky-disable only ENGAGES on a sync-incompatible ICD (6 consecutive fence
timeouts). On the known-good Proton 11 + Turnip path framegen never force-disables, so the fix is
logic-verified by code; on-device this run is a **regression check** = confirm 2× still works + flow
slider still hot-reloads cleanly (i.e. my change didn't break the happy path). ⏳ awaiting user launch;
logcat → `/sdcard/Download/bionicfg_sticky_disable_test.txt`.

---

## 2026-06-21 — PR #6 review-followup `.so` (`4b99b2d1`) DEVICE-CONFIRMED ✅

Hot-swapped the new layer (`libbionic_fg_4b99b2d1.so`, build run 27915620310, fork HEAD `5f4fc03`)
into the installed app's imagefs — **no reinstall** — and tested on device. **All green.**

- **Frame gen 2× confirmed** (game "FOLLOW MY LIGHT", Screenshot_20260621-155950): DXVK base HUD
  **29.9 fps** → Banner overlay **60 fps** = 2.00×. Adreno 750, GPU 58%.
- **FPS-limiter pacing confirmed** (Screenshot_20260621-160008): in-game FPS Limiter "Limit FPS" ON,
  Max FPS = 30 → overlay ≈ **60–63 fps** (cap × mult). The relaxed clamp + new variance-aware
  pacing path work.
- **New container:** ran on **Proton 11.0-5-arm64ec** + Mesa Turnip v26.2.0 + zink (prior proofs
  were on older containers). Layer loads clean: `VK_LAYER_BIONIC_framegen Device created` →
  `SwapchainState provisioned 1280x720` → `FramegenContext ready mult=2 model=0
  graph=model0-full-of-chain`; config hot-reload flow 0.90→1.00 live.
- **CPU-temp HUD fix holds** (79.7 / 86.6 °C real values).
- **No app crash.** No FATAL/SIGSEGV/tombstone for `com.winlator.banner` or `libbionic_fg`. Display
  went `committedState OFF` at 15:59:41 (backgrounded); the ANR storm after 16:01 is
  `com.qti.diagservices` = AYANEO firmware nvkeeper/diag bug, unrelated. The Claude session is what
  died (known device-launch issue).
- **Benign noise (cleanup candidate):** `failed to load layer libVkLayer_LSFGVK_frame_generation.so:
  libc++_shared.so not found` — that's the *old* LSFGVK-named layer in the APK `lib/arm64`, not our
  layer. Our `VK_LAYER_BIONIC_framegen` (imagefs/usr/lib) loads fine. Strip-or-bundle-libc++ before
  the PR push.

Log `/sdcard/Download/bionicfg_pr_followups_test.txt`; `.so` staged `/sdcard/Download/libbionic_fg_4b99b2d1.so`.

**NEXT (now unblocked):** post the 3 drafted replies to Jason (1093/1334/manifest:17) → push fork
`5f4fc03` to PR #6 branch `bannerlator-android-wrapper-icd-fixes` (one clean batch) → build APK from
`feature/bionic-fg-pr-followups` for the app-side niceties (next reinstall). GN #1443 verify deferred.

## 2026-06-20 — 1.3 shipped public + upstream PR review cycle (in progress)

**1.3 released (public).** Repo flipped public (secret-scanned first), `Bannerlator 1.3` release
created (run 27878418873) with all 3 flavors; release notes credit xXJSONDeruloXx with links to
[bionic-fg](https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/bionic-fg) and [PR #6](https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/bionic-fg/pull/6).
README updated to 1.3 (fixed standard package id `com.winlator.banner`, version line, added the
Frame Generation feature section).

**Upstream PR #6 opened and reviewed.** Fork `The412Banner/bionic-fg` branch
`bannerlator-android-wrapper-icd-fixes`. Jason (xXJSONDeruloXx) left 9 inline review comments;
all 9 answered. He's constructive and wants it in with refinements. Work plan (layer fixes land on
the fork branch → update the PR; app-side conf-key changes land on a new Bannerlator branch
`feature/bionic-fg-pr-followups`):

- **A — separate copy vs generated fence-timeout counters.** Real bug he found: the shared counter
  reset on copy-fence success, so generated-frame timeouts could never reach the disable threshold.
  **Done** (fork commit `4c259f8`): split into `copyFenceTimeouts` / `genFenceTimeouts`, each reset
  only on its own fence type.
- **B — timeout rework + split the generated-frame deadline from the sync-incompatibility recovery
  path.** **Done** (fork commit `345e35e`): frame-budget-scaled sync timeout (4× base interval,
  clamped 200 ms–1 s, else 500 ms), disable threshold 2→6, and a separate shorter generated-frame
  cadence deadline (~2× the output interval) that just skips a late frame without counting it as a
  sync failure. A+B compile-validated via CI.
- **C — fps_limit ergonomics:** justify/relax the 10–200 clamp + add an `fps_limit_enabled` bool so
  the value is remembered across toggles. (layer + app) — *todo*
- **D — optional even-pacing** of generated presents to `1s/(base×mult)` behind an opt-in flag,
  off by default. (layer + app) — *todo*
- **E — document** ENABLE+DISABLE precedence in the manifest (disable wins). Trivial. — *todo*

**Device-creation regression (his main concern) — direction changed after his reply.** The JNI/native
path is unchanged (`Device::create()`, owned + destroyed); only the Vulkan-layer path uses
`Device::wrap()` of the app's device. Jason confirmed **GameNative also uses the layer path**, so our
change reaches it too. Arch root cause: standalone mode runs a second VkDevice and hands frames across
it via `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL` transfers, which need a shared queue/timeline; a wrapper ICD bridges
each guest device to Turnip as a separate host context, so that cross-device sync never completes →
hang. Single-device avoids it by running interpolation on the app's own device (intra-device sync).

**Plan:** likely **no flag** — single-device is probably the correct layer default for both stacks.
**Critical next step: verify single-device on GameNative [PR #1443](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative/pull/1443).**
If it's clean there, make single-device the layer default; only add an init-time `single_device`
launch arg (it can't hot-reload — device is created at init) if GN regresses. Fork commits A–B are
held locally and not yet pushed to PR #6; push as one batch after the GN question is settled and our
stack is re-tested.

## 2026-06-20 — bionic-fg FRAME GEN + FPS LIMITER: merged to main, version → 1.3

**FPS-limiter pacing device-confirmed (Phase 4 complete).** The deferred pacer (built into
the bionic-fg Vulkan layer, `.so` md5 `c8e4b188`) ran on device with `fps_limit=30`: base
DXVK frames locked at ~30 while the on-screen overlay stepped 60 → 90 → 122 as the in-game
FG selector went 2× → 3× → 4× (i.e. on-screen = limit × multiplier). Proven on the OpenGL
host renderer (log `bionicfg_fpslimit_test.txt` + 5 screenshots). The pacer sits at the top
of `BionicFG_QueuePresentKHR`, gated `!st.inPresent && fpsLimit>0`, so it throttles only the
app's real frames; generated frames (presented with `inPresent` true) bypass it. Verified the
pacer `.so` is bundled in the shipped APK asset (`assets/bionic-fg/libbionic_fg.so` md5
`c8e4b188`), not hand-staged.

**Merged to main (`ddf46fb`).** Merged `feature/bionic-fg-framegen` (HEAD `f39b96a`) into main.
One conflict in `.github/workflows/build-bionic-fg.yml` (both branches had it) resolved by
keeping the feature branch's version (the one with the patch-apply step). Stale
`BIONIC_FG_UPSTREAM_REPORT.md` working-tree edit reverted (falsely said single-device crashes;
run6 disproved it). Feature branch kept until the upstream PR is cut.

**CI: artifacts build now produces all 3 flavors (`eb30d1b`).** Previous standard-only build was
a workaround for an OOM (exit 143) caused by packaging the ~588MB APKs in parallel.
`build-artifacts.yml` now runs `assembleStandardDebug assembleLudashiDebug assemblePubgDebug
--no-parallel --max-workers=1` with a larger Gradle heap (serialized packaging) and requires
all 3 uploads. Run 27877129792 confirmed green with all 3 artifacts.

**Version relabel → 1.3 (`9ee5cb2`, `90ce00b`).** Fresh-install Android "All files access"
permission screen showed `1.4-marcescene` (the APK `versionName`) under "Bannerlator Bionic".
Fixed: `app/build.gradle` `versionName "1.4-marcescene"→"1.3"`, `versionCode 20→21`; splash
`SplashScreen.kt` "V 1.2"→"V 1.3" (color unchanged — stays grey `0xFFAAAAAA`); about/main
`MainActivity.kt` stray "V 1.0"→"V 1.3". Build run 27877738210 label `1.3` dispatched on main;
standard APK to be delivered to `/sdcard/Download/Bannerlator-1.3-standard.apk`.

## 2026-06-19 — Vulkan/DXVK/vkd3d BLACK-SCREEN FIX (✅ both renderers device-confirmed)

**Symptom:** native Vulkan + DXVK(d3d8-11) + vkd3d(d3d12) rendered BLACK at full FPS on BOTH
host renderers; OpenGL/DirectDraw/D3D7 fine.

**Root cause:** marcescence shipped the native scanout machinery but left the AHB (DRI3 modifier
1255) present path UNWIRED, and the GL renderer had NO AHB->GL (EGLImage) sampling at all
(GPUImage textureId==0 -> black). Confirmed via device logcat (tag "Dri3": modifier 1255 ->
AHB path taken; pixmaps imported fine -> not an import failure).

**Fix (commit `7d5c9f8`, build label "vkfix3" run 27848179202):** ported proven wiring from
GameNative (utkarshdalal/GameNative, local ~/GameNative):
- `renderer/GPUImage.java` + `cpp/winlator/gpu_image.c`: GPUImage(int socketFd) now locks
  (valid getStride + virtualData) and gained EGLImage support (createImageKHR =
  eglGetNativeClientBufferANDROID + eglCreateImageKHR + glEGLImageTargetTexture2DOES). AHB
  allocated BGRA_8888 (matches X depth-32 / GL_BGRA -> correct colors). unlock-before-release.
- `xserver/extensions/DRI3Extension.java`: setDirectScanout(true) + getStride() width.
- `xserver/extensions/PresentExtension.java`: 3-branch present (Vulkan native+scanout=FLIP /
  Vulkan=COPY via onUpdateWindowContentDirect / GL+SHM=copyArea); relaxed depth 24<->32.
- `XServerDisplayActivity.setupUI` + `VulkanRenderer.setInitialNativeMode`: wired the
  previously-dead Vulkan toggles (native / presentMode / filterMode / swapRB).

**Device results (vkfix3):** ✅ OpenGL host renderer (native Vulkan 1432fps + D3D12/vkd3d
1748fps, correct colors). ✅ Vulkan host renderer (native Vulkan 1449fps, correct colors).

APKs delivered: `/sdcard/Download/Bannerlator-vkfix3-standard.apk` (md5 eebfe339…),
`-pubg.apk` (md5 a7c0acb3…).

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — Native Rendering toggle: device-tested + HUD-freeze fix

User tested the previously-untested Native Rendering+ toggle on the Vulkan host renderer
(AIO Graphics Test, native-Vulkan cube). Two findings:

**1. Windowed content stretches/distorts — EXPECTED, not a bug.** With the graphics test in a
*window* (sub-screen), enabling Native Rendering blits the active swapchain straight to the full
device surface, stretched (LUNARG cube visibly squished). Direct scanout (`onUpdateWindowContent`
FLIP branch → `nativeScanoutSetBuffer`) has no aspect-correct dst path for sub-screen windows;
the aspect-preserving letterbox (`ViewTransformation`, `Math.min`-based) only applies on the
copyArea path. ✅ With the test app **maximized to fullscreen**, native rendering renders the cube
correctly proportioned (FPS still climbs 582→743→…). So for real fullscreen games — the actual use
case — native rendering is correct. Windowed-distortion is a known limitation, not release-blocking.

**2. Perf HUD freezes in Native Rendering — FIXED (commit `f724ec2`).** When Native Rendering was
on, the horizontal perf HUD bar (Vulkan|DXVK|CPU|GPU|…|FPS) froze — values stopped updating while
the game kept animating. Root cause: commit `779967a` wired `hudFrameTick` (which drives
`frameRatingHorizontal.update()`, `XServerDisplayActivity.java:1345`) only into
`onUpdateWindowContentDirect` (the COPY present path). Native rendering uses the FLIP/scanout path
(`PresentExtension.java:154` → `VulkanRenderer.onUpdateWindowContent`), which never called it. Fix:
added `if (hudFrameTick != null) hudFrameTick.accept(window.id);` in the scanout-delivered branch
of `onUpdateWindowContent` (`VulkanRenderer.java:495`), mirroring the COPY path — ticks once per
presented game frame in native mode.

**Build:** `build-artifacts.yml` run `27852720105` (artifacts-only, no release, APK label `hudfix`),
triggered off `main` @ `f724ec2`. ⏳ standard APK to be dropped in `/sdcard/Download/` when green;
HUD fix in native mode still ⏳ device-unconfirmed.

**Next:** device-confirm HUD ticks (and shows a sane FPS — native mode pauses X-side rendering) →
then cut a tagged release (pick a real version; vkfix3/hudfix are just build labels). Cleanup:
graphicsDriverConfig has two competing dialog formats writing the same field.

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — New neon gamepad launcher icon (corner-clip fix)

User supplied a new icon (neon gamepad + magenta chevron + white L-bracket + corner stars on
black, white rounded border) — `/storage/emulated/0/Download/ADM/file_…588.jpg`, 1254×1254 — and
reported the previously-installed icon had its **border corners clipped** by the launcher's
round/squircle mask (device screenshot 20260619-194013, drawer): that old icon was **full-bleed**
(art edge-to-edge) so adaptive masks cut the corners.

**Done (commit `19d62f8`, all 15 files = 5 densities × ic_launcher + ic_launcher_round + adaptive
foreground):**
- Legacy `ic_launcher.png` / `ic_launcher_round.png` (mdpi 48 … xxxhdpi 192) = full image, exact.
- Adaptive foreground (mdpi 108 … xxxhdpi 432) = full art fit into the **safe zone** (~66% of
  canvas, centered, transparent pad) so the launcher mask only ever trims the black margin — the
  white border + corner stars stay fully visible under ANY mask shape. Generated with ImageMagick.
- Adaptive background was already `@color/ic_launcher_background` = `#000000` (matches art bg) → no
  change needed; seamless (image black bg blends into adaptive black).
- No per-flavor icon overrides → shared `main/res` applies to all 3 flavors (standard/ludashi/pubg).
- User explicitly chose "full white border visible" over a bigger near-full-bleed (88%) variant.

**Build:** `build-artifacts.yml` run `27853329322` (artifacts-only, label `neonicon`, off `main` @
`19d62f8`). ✅ standard APK delivered `/sdcard/Download/Bannerlator-neonicon-standard.apk` (md5
`13056a0e2845f56ca34b00405abd3afb`). ⏳ icon device-unconfirmed (note: Android caches launcher icons
— reboot / clear launcher cache if old clipped icon persists).

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — 🏁 RELEASE 1.2 + README features/download button

**Released Bannerlator 1.2** (`release.yml`, run `27853787348`): tag `1.2`, marked **Latest**,
non-prerelease, 3 flavor APKs attached. Standard APK → `/sdcard/Download/Bannerlator-1.2-standard.apk`
(md5 `e5d5689ecf4b9b1a91596d70658a752f`). `release.yml` inputs = `release_tag` / `release_title` /
`release_number` / `release_notes` (publishes `make_latest:true`, supersedes 1.1).

1.2 changelog (commits since `1.1` tag): Vulkan/DXVK/vkd3d black-screen fix (`7d5c9f8` + lead-ups
`b7d4f3a`/`c4d252c`), Native Rendering+ toggle wired (`779967a`), HUD-freeze fix on FLIP path
(`f724ec2`), GL-only effects greyed out on Vulkan (`ba06bc3`/`df3a5c7`), DXVK/VKD3D/Vegas version-list
refresh (`00a2544`), new neon icon (`19d62f8`).

**Splash version** bumped `V 1.1` → `V 1.2` (`SplashScreen.kt:164`, commit `a598584`) BEFORE the
release so it shipped in 1.2.

**README** (commits `ae5d9b7` + `18eab3d`): added **✨ Full Features** section (7 grouped categories —
Windows compat / graphics layers / renderers / containers / games+input / UI+overlay / builds; every
item cross-checked against actual code, NO invented features like AI frame-gen which isn't in this
app); bumped Information-table version V 1.0→V 1.2; added a centered shields.io **Download button**
linking to `/releases/latest` + a "Download" entry in the nav row.

**GameNative render-fix credit** (commit `8792f6d`): expanded the README GameNative credit row to
state its rendering pipeline was the **reference used to fix/rewire the render options** (AHB present
path → Vulkan/DXVK/VKD3D on both renderers: GPUImage socket-buffer lock + EGLImage sampling, DRI3
direct-scanout, Present FLIP/COPY branches, Native Rendering+ scanout). Also appended a **Credits**
section to the **1.2 GitHub release notes** (`gh release edit 1.2`) crediting GameNative (utkarshdalal)
for the same, linking back to the README Credits.

**Next:** device-confirm HUD-tick + new icon on 1.2; cleanup graphicsDriverConfig's 2 competing
dialog formats.

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — bionic-fg frame generation: recon + branch `feature/bionic-fg-framegen`

New feature kicked off: integrate [bionic-fg](https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/bionic-fg) (Android/
bionic Vulkan frame-generation layer, LSFG lineage — same engine GameHub ships as `libGameScopeVK.so`)
as **(a)** a per-container option and **(b)** a live in-game side-menu control.

**Author permission GRANTED** (xXJSONDeruloXx). Terms: (1) credit in README, (2) if source goes in
tree do it as a **git submodule** (his preference), (3) feedback/PRs welcome.

**Recon findings:**
- Guest Vulkan goes through a **wrapper ICD** (`wrapper_icd.aarch64.json` + `GALLIUM_DRIVER=zink` +
  `WRAPPER_*` at `XServerDisplayActivity.java:1823–1861`) bridging to the **Android bionic GPU driver**
  via **adrenotools** — exactly the context bionic-fg targets.
- Tree already has frame-gen groundwork: `app/src/main/cpp/lsfg-vk/` (stub CMakeLists, build excluded)
  + root `build-lsfg-android.sh`. bionic-fg = the bionic-targeted sibling.
- **All 3 CI workflows already use `submodules: recursive`** → adding the submodule needs NO CI change.
- In-game drawer (`XServerDrawerState.kt`) uses StateFlow+Runnable; Native Rendering toggle is a
  turnkey template for a Frame-Gen toggle. bionic-fg **hot-reloads its TOML** → in-game live control
  by rewriting the config (multiplier 0=off / 2–4× / model 0-1 / flow_scale).
- ⚠️ **Critical unknown:** does the wrapper expose a `VkSwapchainKHR` for the layer to hook, or does
  it AHB-export with no WSI swapchain? Resolve with a verification spike BEFORE building UI.

**Deliverable this session:** branch `feature/bionic-fg-framegen` created off `main`; full recon +
phased job task list written to **`BIONIC_FG_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md`** (Phase 0 honor-terms → 1 native
build → 2 spike/de-risk → 3 container setting → 4 in-game menu → 5 polish/release/give-back).

**Next on branch:** Phase 0 — add bionic-fg as a submodule under `app/src/main/cpp/bionic-fg` +
README credit; then the Phase 2 verification spike (gate the rest on it).

### ✅ Phase 0 DONE (2026-06-19) — author terms honored
- Added **bionic-fg as a git submodule** at `app/src/main/cpp/bionic-fg` (his preference), pinned at
  `4f71770`; new root `.gitmodules`. CI needs no change (all 3 workflows already `submodules: recursive`).
- **README credit**: added xXJSONDeruloXx / bionic-fg to the Credits table (frame-generation layer,
  in-tree as a submodule with permission) + a "Frame Generation (bionic-fg)" row in the upstream-stack
  table.
- ⚠️ Submodule has **no LICENSE** → carry to Phase 5.2 (ask author before bundling in a release).
- **Next:** Phase 2 verification spike — build `libbionic_fg.so`, hand-wire one container's env +
  `conf.toml`, launch a DXVK game, confirm via logcat whether the layer engages (wrapper exposes a
  `VkSwapchainKHR`?) BEFORE any UI work.

### ✅ Phase 1 DONE (2026-06-19) — native build
- `build-bionic-fg.yml` (standalone, NDK 26.1.10909125 + cmake 3.22.1, arm64-v8a/android-26). Run
  **27854824786 ✅** → artifact `bionic-fg-arm64` (1.65 MB) = `libbionic_fg.so` (ELF aarch64,
  Android 26, NDK r26b — matches our minSdk 26) + `VkLayer_BIONIC_framegen.json`. Workflow also added
  to `main` (dispatch-only/inert) since workflow_dispatch requires the file on the default branch.
- **Manifest insights (sharpen the spike):** layer is **IMPLICIT** (`enable_environment
  BIONIC_FG_ENABLE=1`); `library_path ../../../lib/libbionic_fg.so` → manifest goes in
  `…/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/`, .so in sibling `lib/`. Implicit layers are found via system
  dirs / `VK_ADD_IMPLICIT_LAYER_PATH` (NOT `VK_LAYER_PATH`, which is explicit-only). Hooks
  vkGetInstance/DeviceProcAddr → sits above the ICD.
- **Refined crux:** bionic `.so` CANNOT load in the glibc guest (box64/Wine) → must load **host-side**
  where the wrapper-ICD server runs Turnip via adrenotools. Spike must confirm (1) host loader honors
  the implicit layer, (2) a real `VkSwapchainKHR` exists to hook (vs AHB-export = nothing to
  intercept). Copy GameHub `libGameScopeVK` imagefs placement.
- Artifact staged for device spike: `/sdcard/Download/bionic-fg/{libbionic_fg.so,VkLayer_BIONIC_framegen.json}`.
- **Next:** Phase 2 spike (needs a device launch — log to crash-surviving `/sdcard/Download/*.txt`
  per the device-launch rule; hold the actual launch for the user).

### Phase 2 spike — runbook written + device recon (2026-06-19)
- **`BIONIC_FG_SPIKE_RUNBOOK.md`** written: full device steps (place `.so` in `imagefs/usr/lib`,
  manifest in `implicit_layer.d`, `BIONIC_FG_ENABLE=1` + `VK_LOADER_DEBUG=all` in container Env Vars,
  conf.toml at guest `$HOME/.config/bionic-fg/`, logcat→`/sdcard/Download/bionicfg_spike.txt`) +
  a decision table + cleanup.
- **Device recon (root bridge):** guest uses its **own glibc Khronos loader**
  `imagefs/usr/lib/libvulkan.so.1.4.315` and already loads **glibc** implicit layers — **MangoHud**
  (`VK_LAYER_MANGOHUD_overlay_aarch64`) + `libutil_layer` — from `usr/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/`.
  MangoHud's manifest is structurally identical to bionic-fg's (enable_environment, `../../../lib/…`,
  same proc-addr hooks) → **discovery works**.
- ⚠️ **KEY HYPOTHESIS:** our NDK/**bionic** `libbionic_fg.so` (links libandroid/liblog/Android
  libvulkan) **will not load in the glibc guest loader** → real path is a **glibc aarch64 build**
  (new Phase 1.5), mirroring how MangoHud + GameHub `libGameScopeVK` ship in imagefs. The spike's
  Test A is designed to confirm this fast (expect a `cannot open shared object`/`libandroid` load
  error), then pivot.
- Standard pkg confirmed `com.winlator.banner` (pubg `com.tencent.ig`); both installed.
- **Next (user):** run the spike launch per the runbook; report the log signals.

### Phase 2 spike ARMED on device (2026-06-19) — awaiting user launch
- Test workload = **DOOMBLADE** (user's choice; real DX11/DXVK game) in **container 2 "P10arm"**
  (`imagefs/home/xuser-2`, the ACTIVE container; arm64ec, DXVK 2.4.1+vkd3d, Turnip, FPS HUD on).
- Staged via root bridge: `libbionic_fg.so` → `imagefs/usr/lib/`, `VkLayer_BIONIC_framegen.json` →
  `imagefs/usr/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/`, `conf.toml` (multiplier=2) →
  `imagefs/home/xuser-2/.config/bionic-fg/`. All chown'd back to app uid `u0_a478`.
- Container 2 `.container` env vars **prepended** `BIONIC_FG_ENABLE=1 VK_LOADER_DEBUG=all`
  (backup at `.container.bak_bfg`).
- Logcat capture → `/sdcard/Download/bionicfg_spike.txt`.
- **REVERT if needed:** restore `imagefs/home/xuser-2/.container.bak_bfg`; rm the staged
  `.so`/manifest/`.config/bionic-fg`.
- ⚠️ Expectation: bionic `.so` likely fails to load in glibc guest loader (ABI) → then Phase 1.5
  glibc build. Spike confirms.

## Feedback Fix Plan

Source: Developer feedback comparing v1.1 (old Java/XML) vs Compose version.  
8 issues identified. Listed in execution order (smallest/highest impact first).

---

### Job 1 — Help and Support (BROKEN)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `93d0326`, CI run `24569312463`  
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/AppDrawer.kt`  
**Problem:** `onClick = { /* TODO: open help URL or dialog */ }` — tapping does nothing  
**Fix:** Replace the TODO with a Compose `AlertDialog` containing:
- GitHub repo link: https://github.com/The412Banner/star-compose
- Issue tracker link
- A "Close" button
Or alternatively open a URL via `Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url))`.  
**Effort:** 30 min  
**Commit message:** `fix: implement Help and Support dialog`

---

### Job 2 — About Dialog (MISSING CONTENT)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `d18cae6`, CI run `24569669122`  
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/MainActivity.kt` — `AboutDialog()` at bottom of file  
**Problem:** Current dialog is 4 lines of plain text. Missing: app icon/logo, version name, Wine/Box64/FEX versions, credits list.  
**Fix:** Rebuild `AboutDialog()` as a proper Compose `Dialog` (not AlertDialog — needs more space) with:
- App icon (R.mipmap.ic_launcher_foreground)
- App name + version (read from `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME` + `BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE`)
- Powered-by section: Wine, Box64, FEX-Emu, Turnip
- Credits section with contributor names
- Close button  
**Effort:** 45 min  
**Commit message:** `feat: rebuild About dialog with logo, version, credits`

---

### Job 3 — Container Creation Loading Indicator
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `2e5f4a1`, CI run `24570142005`  
**Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainerDetailScreen.kt` — Save button / confirm action
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainerDetailViewModel.kt` — `saveContainer()` or equivalent
**Problem:** When user taps Save on a new container, it creates silently with no progress feedback. On slow devices this looks like a freeze.  
**Fix:**
1. Add `isCreating: StateFlow<Boolean>` to `ContainerDetailViewModel`
2. Set it true before container creation starts, false when done
3. In `ContainerDetailScreen`, show a full-screen semi-transparent overlay with `CircularProgressIndicator` + "Creating container…" text when `isCreating == true`
4. Disable the Save button while creating  
**Effort:** 45 min  
**Commit message:** `feat: add loading overlay during container creation`

---

### Job 4 — Settings Theme Mismatch (Dark Mode Toggle Broken)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `44a4bdb`, CI run `24571445525`  
**Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/theme/AppThemeState.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/theme/ThemePreset.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/theme/Theme.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/MainActivity.kt`
**Problem (two parts):**
1. `SettingsFragment` uses Light XML AppTheme while the rest of the app is dark Compose — mismatched look inside the Settings screen
2. The `dark_mode` SharedPreferences toggle in SettingsFragment has no effect on the Compose UI — `WinlatorTheme` always uses `darkColorScheme()`  
**Fix:**
1. Read `PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this).getBoolean("dark_mode", false)` in `AppThemeState.init()` and store it as `isDarkMode: StateFlow<Boolean>`
2. Add a light variant to each `ThemePreset` (or use Material3 `lightColorScheme()` as the light base)
3. `AppThemeState.colorScheme` flow emits light or dark scheme based on `isDarkMode`
4. Register a `SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener` so toggling dark mode in Settings updates the flow in real time without restart
5. For SettingsFragment XML mismatch: set `android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.DayNight"` on the fragment's parent or override the fragment background to match Compose surface color  
**Effort:** 1.5 hours  
**Commit message:** `fix: wire dark_mode preference to Compose theme + fix Settings appearance`

---

### Job 5 — Sort Shortcut List
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `00dc6a5`, CI run `24571836336`  
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ShortcutsScreen.kt`  
**Problem:** No sort option — shortcuts always appear in filesystem order  
**Fix:**
1. Add a sort icon button in the top bar or a sort dropdown in the shortcuts screen
2. Sort options: Name A→Z, Name Z→A, Last Played, Container
3. Store selected sort in `ShortcutsViewModel` (persisted to SharedPreferences)
4. Apply sort to the `shortcuts` StateFlow before emitting  
**Effort:** 1 hour  
**Commit message:** `feat: add sort options to shortcuts list`

---

### Job 6 — Import/Export Container
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `8477b65`, CI run `24572308670`  
**Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainersScreen.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainersViewModel.kt`
**Problem:** The old `ContainersFragment` had import/export container options. These are missing from the Compose version.  
**Fix:**
1. Add "Import Container" and "Export Container" options to the container long-press context menu (already has Duplicate/Delete)
2. Check original `ContainersFragment.java` (deleted) — refer to git history if needed, or find the logic in `ContainerManager.java`
3. Export: zip the container directory → write to Downloads or user-picked location via `ActivityResultContracts.CreateDocument`
4. Import: user picks a zip via `ActivityResultContracts.GetContent` → unzip to containers directory → reload list  
**Check ContainerManager.java for existing import/export methods first** — they likely already exist.  
**Effort:** 1.5 hours  
**Commit message:** `feat: add import/export container to containers screen`

---

### Job 7 — Add Shortcut from External Storage
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `546d25e`, CI run `24577265773`  
**Files:** `ShortcutsViewModel.kt`, `ShortcutsScreen.kt`

---

### Job 8 — Shortcut List Layout Toggle (Grid / List)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `546d25e`, CI run `24577265773`  
**Files:** `ShortcutsViewModel.kt`, `ShortcutsScreen.kt`

## 2026-06-28 — NIS device-test checkpoint (feat/deband-nis)

**Status:** Vulkan NIS ✅ device-proven by user ("it works on Vulkan"). OpenGL/GL NIS ⏳ device-test in progress (Adreno runtime-compile risk = the open question).

**NIS sharpness slider (resolved from committed source, this session):**
- CONTINUOUS on BOTH renderers — every value 0–100 is live (GL `XServerDrawer.kt:463` steps=-1 for mode 7; VK `:547` no steps arg). Not notched.
- GL & VK share the SAME NVIDIA `NVScalerUpdateConfig` constants (stock, untuned) → identical strength on both:
  - slider 0 ≈ OFF (max USM strength ~0.03, overshoot limit ±20%)
  - slider 50 = NVIDIA neutral default (1.6, ±50%)
  - slider 75 = our seeded default (~2.16, ±69%)
  - slider 100 = hard max (~2.73, ±87% — halo onset)
- Input is `clamp(sharpness,0,1)`; 100 cannot be exceeded without editing shader constants. Curve is piecewise-linear with one slope kink at 50 (steeper above), plus soft floors ~17 & ~37 at the low end.

**Side-finding (NOT NIS — cleanup candidate, UNFIXED):** CAS/Sharpen slider snapping is inconsistent across renderers.
- OpenGL: Scaling-mode "Sharpen" (mode 6, `glUpscaleSharpness` steps=3) + standalone "Sharpen (CAS)" toggle (`sgsrSharpness` steps=3) → snap to 5 notches {0,25,50,75,100}.
- Vulkan: "Sharpen" mode 6 (`upscaleSharpness` :547) + standalone "CAS" toggle (`casSharpness` :568) → continuous.
- Fix later: add `steps=3` to the two VK sliders, or drop `steps` on the two GL ones (lean continuous-everywhere; GL keeps notches only for the "stop 0 = OFF" guarantee).

**UPDATE 2026-06-28 (later):** ✅ OpenGL NIS DEVICE-PROVEN — user: "it worked like vulkan". Adreno GL shader-compile risk CLEARED. NIS now proven on BOTH renderers, matching looks. (Install: NIS vc32 needed `pm install -r -d` over the bionic-fg vc33 build via root bridge.) NIS feature merge-ready; debanding (other half of branch) may want a quick dark-gradient check before merge.

**RESUME POINT (2026-06-28, user driving home):** Step 1 NIS = DONE, device-proven both renderers. NEXT SESSION = **Step 2: VRR / refresh-rate matching** (full plan in roadmap memory file). Open optional threads to fold in: (a) debanding dark-gradient check + merge `feat/deband-nis` to main; (b) CAS/Sharpen snapping cleanup (GL 5-notch vs VK continuous). Branch tip `cc3361f`, pushed, unmerged.
