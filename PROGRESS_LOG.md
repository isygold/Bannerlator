## 2026-06-20 — bionic-fg FRAME GEN + FPS LIMITER: merged to main, version → 1.3

**FPS-limiter pacing device-confirmed (Phase 4 complete).** The deferred pacer (built into
the bionic-fg Vulkan layer, `.so` md5 `c8e4b188`) ran on device with `fps_limit=30`: base
DXVK frames locked at ~30 while the on-screen overlay stepped 60 → 90 → 122 as the in-game
FG selector went 2× → 3× → 4× (i.e. on-screen = limit × multiplier). Proven on the OpenGL
host renderer (log `bionicfg_fpslimit_test.txt` + 5 screenshots). The pacer sits at the top
of `BionicFG_QueuePresentKHR`, gated `!st.inPresent && fpsLimit>0`, so it throttles only the
app's real frames; generated frames (presented with `inPresent` true) bypass it. Verified the
pacer `.so` is bundled in the shipped APK asset (`assets/bionic-fg/libbionic_fg.so` md5
`c8e4b188`), not hand-staged.

**Merged to main (`ddf46fb`).** Merged `feature/bionic-fg-framegen` (HEAD `f39b96a`) into main.
One conflict in `.github/workflows/build-bionic-fg.yml` (both branches had it) resolved by
keeping the feature branch's version (the one with the patch-apply step). Stale
`BIONIC_FG_UPSTREAM_REPORT.md` working-tree edit reverted (falsely said single-device crashes;
run6 disproved it). Feature branch kept until the upstream PR is cut.

**CI: artifacts build now produces all 3 flavors (`eb30d1b`).** Previous standard-only build was
a workaround for an OOM (exit 143) caused by packaging the ~588MB APKs in parallel.
`build-artifacts.yml` now runs `assembleStandardDebug assembleLudashiDebug assemblePubgDebug
--no-parallel --max-workers=1` with a larger Gradle heap (serialized packaging) and requires
all 3 uploads. Run 27877129792 confirmed green with all 3 artifacts.

**Version relabel → 1.3 (`9ee5cb2`, `90ce00b`).** Fresh-install Android "All files access"
permission screen showed `1.4-marcescene` (the APK `versionName`) under "Bannerlator Bionic".
Fixed: `app/build.gradle` `versionName "1.4-marcescene"→"1.3"`, `versionCode 20→21`; splash
`SplashScreen.kt` "V 1.2"→"V 1.3" (color unchanged — stays grey `0xFFAAAAAA`); about/main
`MainActivity.kt` stray "V 1.0"→"V 1.3". Build run 27877738210 label `1.3` dispatched on main;
standard APK to be delivered to `/sdcard/Download/Bannerlator-1.3-standard.apk`.

## 2026-06-19 — Vulkan/DXVK/vkd3d BLACK-SCREEN FIX (✅ both renderers device-confirmed)

**Symptom:** native Vulkan + DXVK(d3d8-11) + vkd3d(d3d12) rendered BLACK at full FPS on BOTH
host renderers; OpenGL/DirectDraw/D3D7 fine.

**Root cause:** marcescence shipped the native scanout machinery but left the AHB (DRI3 modifier
1255) present path UNWIRED, and the GL renderer had NO AHB->GL (EGLImage) sampling at all
(GPUImage textureId==0 -> black). Confirmed via device logcat (tag "Dri3": modifier 1255 ->
AHB path taken; pixmaps imported fine -> not an import failure).

**Fix (commit `7d5c9f8`, build label "vkfix3" run 27848179202):** ported proven wiring from
GameNative (utkarshdalal/GameNative, local ~/GameNative):
- `renderer/GPUImage.java` + `cpp/winlator/gpu_image.c`: GPUImage(int socketFd) now locks
  (valid getStride + virtualData) and gained EGLImage support (createImageKHR =
  eglGetNativeClientBufferANDROID + eglCreateImageKHR + glEGLImageTargetTexture2DOES). AHB
  allocated BGRA_8888 (matches X depth-32 / GL_BGRA -> correct colors). unlock-before-release.
- `xserver/extensions/DRI3Extension.java`: setDirectScanout(true) + getStride() width.
- `xserver/extensions/PresentExtension.java`: 3-branch present (Vulkan native+scanout=FLIP /
  Vulkan=COPY via onUpdateWindowContentDirect / GL+SHM=copyArea); relaxed depth 24<->32.
- `XServerDisplayActivity.setupUI` + `VulkanRenderer.setInitialNativeMode`: wired the
  previously-dead Vulkan toggles (native / presentMode / filterMode / swapRB).

**Device results (vkfix3):** ✅ OpenGL host renderer (native Vulkan 1432fps + D3D12/vkd3d
1748fps, correct colors). ✅ Vulkan host renderer (native Vulkan 1449fps, correct colors).

APKs delivered: `/sdcard/Download/Bannerlator-vkfix3-standard.apk` (md5 eebfe339…),
`-pubg.apk` (md5 a7c0acb3…).

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — Native Rendering toggle: device-tested + HUD-freeze fix

User tested the previously-untested Native Rendering+ toggle on the Vulkan host renderer
(AIO Graphics Test, native-Vulkan cube). Two findings:

**1. Windowed content stretches/distorts — EXPECTED, not a bug.** With the graphics test in a
*window* (sub-screen), enabling Native Rendering blits the active swapchain straight to the full
device surface, stretched (LUNARG cube visibly squished). Direct scanout (`onUpdateWindowContent`
FLIP branch → `nativeScanoutSetBuffer`) has no aspect-correct dst path for sub-screen windows;
the aspect-preserving letterbox (`ViewTransformation`, `Math.min`-based) only applies on the
copyArea path. ✅ With the test app **maximized to fullscreen**, native rendering renders the cube
correctly proportioned (FPS still climbs 582→743→…). So for real fullscreen games — the actual use
case — native rendering is correct. Windowed-distortion is a known limitation, not release-blocking.

**2. Perf HUD freezes in Native Rendering — FIXED (commit `f724ec2`).** When Native Rendering was
on, the horizontal perf HUD bar (Vulkan|DXVK|CPU|GPU|…|FPS) froze — values stopped updating while
the game kept animating. Root cause: commit `779967a` wired `hudFrameTick` (which drives
`frameRatingHorizontal.update()`, `XServerDisplayActivity.java:1345`) only into
`onUpdateWindowContentDirect` (the COPY present path). Native rendering uses the FLIP/scanout path
(`PresentExtension.java:154` → `VulkanRenderer.onUpdateWindowContent`), which never called it. Fix:
added `if (hudFrameTick != null) hudFrameTick.accept(window.id);` in the scanout-delivered branch
of `onUpdateWindowContent` (`VulkanRenderer.java:495`), mirroring the COPY path — ticks once per
presented game frame in native mode.

**Build:** `build-artifacts.yml` run `27852720105` (artifacts-only, no release, APK label `hudfix`),
triggered off `main` @ `f724ec2`. ⏳ standard APK to be dropped in `/sdcard/Download/` when green;
HUD fix in native mode still ⏳ device-unconfirmed.

**Next:** device-confirm HUD ticks (and shows a sane FPS — native mode pauses X-side rendering) →
then cut a tagged release (pick a real version; vkfix3/hudfix are just build labels). Cleanup:
graphicsDriverConfig has two competing dialog formats writing the same field.

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — New neon gamepad launcher icon (corner-clip fix)

User supplied a new icon (neon gamepad + magenta chevron + white L-bracket + corner stars on
black, white rounded border) — `/storage/emulated/0/Download/ADM/file_…588.jpg`, 1254×1254 — and
reported the previously-installed icon had its **border corners clipped** by the launcher's
round/squircle mask (device screenshot 20260619-194013, drawer): that old icon was **full-bleed**
(art edge-to-edge) so adaptive masks cut the corners.

**Done (commit `19d62f8`, all 15 files = 5 densities × ic_launcher + ic_launcher_round + adaptive
foreground):**
- Legacy `ic_launcher.png` / `ic_launcher_round.png` (mdpi 48 … xxxhdpi 192) = full image, exact.
- Adaptive foreground (mdpi 108 … xxxhdpi 432) = full art fit into the **safe zone** (~66% of
  canvas, centered, transparent pad) so the launcher mask only ever trims the black margin — the
  white border + corner stars stay fully visible under ANY mask shape. Generated with ImageMagick.
- Adaptive background was already `@color/ic_launcher_background` = `#000000` (matches art bg) → no
  change needed; seamless (image black bg blends into adaptive black).
- No per-flavor icon overrides → shared `main/res` applies to all 3 flavors (standard/ludashi/pubg).
- User explicitly chose "full white border visible" over a bigger near-full-bleed (88%) variant.

**Build:** `build-artifacts.yml` run `27853329322` (artifacts-only, label `neonicon`, off `main` @
`19d62f8`). ✅ standard APK delivered `/sdcard/Download/Bannerlator-neonicon-standard.apk` (md5
`13056a0e2845f56ca34b00405abd3afb`). ⏳ icon device-unconfirmed (note: Android caches launcher icons
— reboot / clear launcher cache if old clipped icon persists).

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — 🏁 RELEASE 1.2 + README features/download button

**Released Bannerlator 1.2** (`release.yml`, run `27853787348`): tag `1.2`, marked **Latest**,
non-prerelease, 3 flavor APKs attached. Standard APK → `/sdcard/Download/Bannerlator-1.2-standard.apk`
(md5 `e5d5689ecf4b9b1a91596d70658a752f`). `release.yml` inputs = `release_tag` / `release_title` /
`release_number` / `release_notes` (publishes `make_latest:true`, supersedes 1.1).

1.2 changelog (commits since `1.1` tag): Vulkan/DXVK/vkd3d black-screen fix (`7d5c9f8` + lead-ups
`b7d4f3a`/`c4d252c`), Native Rendering+ toggle wired (`779967a`), HUD-freeze fix on FLIP path
(`f724ec2`), GL-only effects greyed out on Vulkan (`ba06bc3`/`df3a5c7`), DXVK/VKD3D/Vegas version-list
refresh (`00a2544`), new neon icon (`19d62f8`).

**Splash version** bumped `V 1.1` → `V 1.2` (`SplashScreen.kt:164`, commit `a598584`) BEFORE the
release so it shipped in 1.2.

**README** (commits `ae5d9b7` + `18eab3d`): added **✨ Full Features** section (7 grouped categories —
Windows compat / graphics layers / renderers / containers / games+input / UI+overlay / builds; every
item cross-checked against actual code, NO invented features like AI frame-gen which isn't in this
app); bumped Information-table version V 1.0→V 1.2; added a centered shields.io **Download button**
linking to `/releases/latest` + a "Download" entry in the nav row.

**GameNative render-fix credit** (commit `8792f6d`): expanded the README GameNative credit row to
state its rendering pipeline was the **reference used to fix/rewire the render options** (AHB present
path → Vulkan/DXVK/VKD3D on both renderers: GPUImage socket-buffer lock + EGLImage sampling, DRI3
direct-scanout, Present FLIP/COPY branches, Native Rendering+ scanout). Also appended a **Credits**
section to the **1.2 GitHub release notes** (`gh release edit 1.2`) crediting GameNative (utkarshdalal)
for the same, linking back to the README Credits.

**Next:** device-confirm HUD-tick + new icon on 1.2; cleanup graphicsDriverConfig's 2 competing
dialog formats.

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — bionic-fg frame generation: recon + branch `feature/bionic-fg-framegen`

New feature kicked off: integrate [bionic-fg](https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/bionic-fg) (Android/
bionic Vulkan frame-generation layer, LSFG lineage — same engine GameHub ships as `libGameScopeVK.so`)
as **(a)** a per-container option and **(b)** a live in-game side-menu control.

**Author permission GRANTED** (xXJSONDeruloXx). Terms: (1) credit in README, (2) if source goes in
tree do it as a **git submodule** (his preference), (3) feedback/PRs welcome.

**Recon findings:**
- Guest Vulkan goes through a **wrapper ICD** (`wrapper_icd.aarch64.json` + `GALLIUM_DRIVER=zink` +
  `WRAPPER_*` at `XServerDisplayActivity.java:1823–1861`) bridging to the **Android bionic GPU driver**
  via **adrenotools** — exactly the context bionic-fg targets.
- Tree already has frame-gen groundwork: `app/src/main/cpp/lsfg-vk/` (stub CMakeLists, build excluded)
  + root `build-lsfg-android.sh`. bionic-fg = the bionic-targeted sibling.
- **All 3 CI workflows already use `submodules: recursive`** → adding the submodule needs NO CI change.
- In-game drawer (`XServerDrawerState.kt`) uses StateFlow+Runnable; Native Rendering toggle is a
  turnkey template for a Frame-Gen toggle. bionic-fg **hot-reloads its TOML** → in-game live control
  by rewriting the config (multiplier 0=off / 2–4× / model 0-1 / flow_scale).
- ⚠️ **Critical unknown:** does the wrapper expose a `VkSwapchainKHR` for the layer to hook, or does
  it AHB-export with no WSI swapchain? Resolve with a verification spike BEFORE building UI.

**Deliverable this session:** branch `feature/bionic-fg-framegen` created off `main`; full recon +
phased job task list written to **`BIONIC_FG_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md`** (Phase 0 honor-terms → 1 native
build → 2 spike/de-risk → 3 container setting → 4 in-game menu → 5 polish/release/give-back).

**Next on branch:** Phase 0 — add bionic-fg as a submodule under `app/src/main/cpp/bionic-fg` +
README credit; then the Phase 2 verification spike (gate the rest on it).

### ✅ Phase 0 DONE (2026-06-19) — author terms honored
- Added **bionic-fg as a git submodule** at `app/src/main/cpp/bionic-fg` (his preference), pinned at
  `4f71770`; new root `.gitmodules`. CI needs no change (all 3 workflows already `submodules: recursive`).
- **README credit**: added xXJSONDeruloXx / bionic-fg to the Credits table (frame-generation layer,
  in-tree as a submodule with permission) + a "Frame Generation (bionic-fg)" row in the upstream-stack
  table.
- ⚠️ Submodule has **no LICENSE** → carry to Phase 5.2 (ask author before bundling in a release).
- **Next:** Phase 2 verification spike — build `libbionic_fg.so`, hand-wire one container's env +
  `conf.toml`, launch a DXVK game, confirm via logcat whether the layer engages (wrapper exposes a
  `VkSwapchainKHR`?) BEFORE any UI work.

### ✅ Phase 1 DONE (2026-06-19) — native build
- `build-bionic-fg.yml` (standalone, NDK 26.1.10909125 + cmake 3.22.1, arm64-v8a/android-26). Run
  **27854824786 ✅** → artifact `bionic-fg-arm64` (1.65 MB) = `libbionic_fg.so` (ELF aarch64,
  Android 26, NDK r26b — matches our minSdk 26) + `VkLayer_BIONIC_framegen.json`. Workflow also added
  to `main` (dispatch-only/inert) since workflow_dispatch requires the file on the default branch.
- **Manifest insights (sharpen the spike):** layer is **IMPLICIT** (`enable_environment
  BIONIC_FG_ENABLE=1`); `library_path ../../../lib/libbionic_fg.so` → manifest goes in
  `…/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/`, .so in sibling `lib/`. Implicit layers are found via system
  dirs / `VK_ADD_IMPLICIT_LAYER_PATH` (NOT `VK_LAYER_PATH`, which is explicit-only). Hooks
  vkGetInstance/DeviceProcAddr → sits above the ICD.
- **Refined crux:** bionic `.so` CANNOT load in the glibc guest (box64/Wine) → must load **host-side**
  where the wrapper-ICD server runs Turnip via adrenotools. Spike must confirm (1) host loader honors
  the implicit layer, (2) a real `VkSwapchainKHR` exists to hook (vs AHB-export = nothing to
  intercept). Copy GameHub `libGameScopeVK` imagefs placement.
- Artifact staged for device spike: `/sdcard/Download/bionic-fg/{libbionic_fg.so,VkLayer_BIONIC_framegen.json}`.
- **Next:** Phase 2 spike (needs a device launch — log to crash-surviving `/sdcard/Download/*.txt`
  per the device-launch rule; hold the actual launch for the user).

### Phase 2 spike — runbook written + device recon (2026-06-19)
- **`BIONIC_FG_SPIKE_RUNBOOK.md`** written: full device steps (place `.so` in `imagefs/usr/lib`,
  manifest in `implicit_layer.d`, `BIONIC_FG_ENABLE=1` + `VK_LOADER_DEBUG=all` in container Env Vars,
  conf.toml at guest `$HOME/.config/bionic-fg/`, logcat→`/sdcard/Download/bionicfg_spike.txt`) +
  a decision table + cleanup.
- **Device recon (root bridge):** guest uses its **own glibc Khronos loader**
  `imagefs/usr/lib/libvulkan.so.1.4.315` and already loads **glibc** implicit layers — **MangoHud**
  (`VK_LAYER_MANGOHUD_overlay_aarch64`) + `libutil_layer` — from `usr/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/`.
  MangoHud's manifest is structurally identical to bionic-fg's (enable_environment, `../../../lib/…`,
  same proc-addr hooks) → **discovery works**.
- ⚠️ **KEY HYPOTHESIS:** our NDK/**bionic** `libbionic_fg.so` (links libandroid/liblog/Android
  libvulkan) **will not load in the glibc guest loader** → real path is a **glibc aarch64 build**
  (new Phase 1.5), mirroring how MangoHud + GameHub `libGameScopeVK` ship in imagefs. The spike's
  Test A is designed to confirm this fast (expect a `cannot open shared object`/`libandroid` load
  error), then pivot.
- Standard pkg confirmed `com.winlator.banner` (pubg `com.tencent.ig`); both installed.
- **Next (user):** run the spike launch per the runbook; report the log signals.

### Phase 2 spike ARMED on device (2026-06-19) — awaiting user launch
- Test workload = **DOOMBLADE** (user's choice; real DX11/DXVK game) in **container 2 "P10arm"**
  (`imagefs/home/xuser-2`, the ACTIVE container; arm64ec, DXVK 2.4.1+vkd3d, Turnip, FPS HUD on).
- Staged via root bridge: `libbionic_fg.so` → `imagefs/usr/lib/`, `VkLayer_BIONIC_framegen.json` →
  `imagefs/usr/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/`, `conf.toml` (multiplier=2) →
  `imagefs/home/xuser-2/.config/bionic-fg/`. All chown'd back to app uid `u0_a478`.
- Container 2 `.container` env vars **prepended** `BIONIC_FG_ENABLE=1 VK_LOADER_DEBUG=all`
  (backup at `.container.bak_bfg`).
- Logcat capture → `/sdcard/Download/bionicfg_spike.txt`.
- **REVERT if needed:** restore `imagefs/home/xuser-2/.container.bak_bfg`; rm the staged
  `.so`/manifest/`.config/bionic-fg`.
- ⚠️ Expectation: bionic `.so` likely fails to load in glibc guest loader (ABI) → then Phase 1.5
  glibc build. Spike confirms.

## Feedback Fix Plan

Source: Developer feedback comparing v1.1 (old Java/XML) vs Compose version.  
8 issues identified. Listed in execution order (smallest/highest impact first).

---

### Job 1 — Help and Support (BROKEN)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `93d0326`, CI run `24569312463`  
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/AppDrawer.kt`  
**Problem:** `onClick = { /* TODO: open help URL or dialog */ }` — tapping does nothing  
**Fix:** Replace the TODO with a Compose `AlertDialog` containing:
- GitHub repo link: https://github.com/The412Banner/star-compose
- Issue tracker link
- A "Close" button
Or alternatively open a URL via `Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url))`.  
**Effort:** 30 min  
**Commit message:** `fix: implement Help and Support dialog`

---

### Job 2 — About Dialog (MISSING CONTENT)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `d18cae6`, CI run `24569669122`  
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/MainActivity.kt` — `AboutDialog()` at bottom of file  
**Problem:** Current dialog is 4 lines of plain text. Missing: app icon/logo, version name, Wine/Box64/FEX versions, credits list.  
**Fix:** Rebuild `AboutDialog()` as a proper Compose `Dialog` (not AlertDialog — needs more space) with:
- App icon (R.mipmap.ic_launcher_foreground)
- App name + version (read from `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME` + `BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE`)
- Powered-by section: Wine, Box64, FEX-Emu, Turnip
- Credits section with contributor names
- Close button  
**Effort:** 45 min  
**Commit message:** `feat: rebuild About dialog with logo, version, credits`

---

### Job 3 — Container Creation Loading Indicator
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `2e5f4a1`, CI run `24570142005`  
**Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainerDetailScreen.kt` — Save button / confirm action
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainerDetailViewModel.kt` — `saveContainer()` or equivalent
**Problem:** When user taps Save on a new container, it creates silently with no progress feedback. On slow devices this looks like a freeze.  
**Fix:**
1. Add `isCreating: StateFlow<Boolean>` to `ContainerDetailViewModel`
2. Set it true before container creation starts, false when done
3. In `ContainerDetailScreen`, show a full-screen semi-transparent overlay with `CircularProgressIndicator` + "Creating container…" text when `isCreating == true`
4. Disable the Save button while creating  
**Effort:** 45 min  
**Commit message:** `feat: add loading overlay during container creation`

---

### Job 4 — Settings Theme Mismatch (Dark Mode Toggle Broken)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `44a4bdb`, CI run `24571445525`  
**Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/theme/AppThemeState.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/theme/ThemePreset.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/theme/Theme.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/MainActivity.kt`
**Problem (two parts):**
1. `SettingsFragment` uses Light XML AppTheme while the rest of the app is dark Compose — mismatched look inside the Settings screen
2. The `dark_mode` SharedPreferences toggle in SettingsFragment has no effect on the Compose UI — `WinlatorTheme` always uses `darkColorScheme()`  
**Fix:**
1. Read `PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this).getBoolean("dark_mode", false)` in `AppThemeState.init()` and store it as `isDarkMode: StateFlow<Boolean>`
2. Add a light variant to each `ThemePreset` (or use Material3 `lightColorScheme()` as the light base)
3. `AppThemeState.colorScheme` flow emits light or dark scheme based on `isDarkMode`
4. Register a `SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener` so toggling dark mode in Settings updates the flow in real time without restart
5. For SettingsFragment XML mismatch: set `android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.DayNight"` on the fragment's parent or override the fragment background to match Compose surface color  
**Effort:** 1.5 hours  
**Commit message:** `fix: wire dark_mode preference to Compose theme + fix Settings appearance`

---

### Job 5 — Sort Shortcut List
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `00dc6a5`, CI run `24571836336`  
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ShortcutsScreen.kt`  
**Problem:** No sort option — shortcuts always appear in filesystem order  
**Fix:**
1. Add a sort icon button in the top bar or a sort dropdown in the shortcuts screen
2. Sort options: Name A→Z, Name Z→A, Last Played, Container
3. Store selected sort in `ShortcutsViewModel` (persisted to SharedPreferences)
4. Apply sort to the `shortcuts` StateFlow before emitting  
**Effort:** 1 hour  
**Commit message:** `feat: add sort options to shortcuts list`

---

### Job 6 — Import/Export Container
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `8477b65`, CI run `24572308670`  
**Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainersScreen.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainersViewModel.kt`
**Problem:** The old `ContainersFragment` had import/export container options. These are missing from the Compose version.  
**Fix:**
1. Add "Import Container" and "Export Container" options to the container long-press context menu (already has Duplicate/Delete)
2. Check original `ContainersFragment.java` (deleted) — refer to git history if needed, or find the logic in `ContainerManager.java`
3. Export: zip the container directory → write to Downloads or user-picked location via `ActivityResultContracts.CreateDocument`
4. Import: user picks a zip via `ActivityResultContracts.GetContent` → unzip to containers directory → reload list  
**Check ContainerManager.java for existing import/export methods first** — they likely already exist.  
**Effort:** 1.5 hours  
**Commit message:** `feat: add import/export container to containers screen`

---

### Job 7 — Add Shortcut from External Storage
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `546d25e`, CI run `24577265773`  
**Files:** `ShortcutsViewModel.kt`, `ShortcutsScreen.kt`

---

### Job 8 — Shortcut List Layout Toggle (Grid / List)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `546d25e`, CI run `24577265773`  
**Files:** `ShortcutsViewModel.kt`, `ShortcutsScreen.kt`
