## 2026-07-03 — 🐛→✅ Goldberg: back up + restore game-shipped steamclient dlls (found while prepping Experimental/ColdClient device test)

> **How it surfaced:** before touching the UI to test the Experimental/ColdClient tiers, inspected Portal 2 on device via the root bridge (`com.winlator.banner`, `imagefs/steam_games/Portal 2`). md5 **confirmed Regular is correctly applied** (in-place api dlls = the bundled Goldberg regular builds; `.bak` files = distinct pristine originals). But Portal 2 also ships its **own** `bin/steamclient.dll` (md5 `4505032f`, not Goldberg's `2983e67d`).
> **Bug:** `GoldbergPatcher.removeAddedFiles` deleted `steamclient.dll`/`steamclient64.dll` **purely by name** (they're in `ADDED_FILE_NAMES`), and `applyExperimental`/`applyColdClient` **overwrote** them with no backup — unlike api dlls, which shared-prep backs up. So any game that ships its own steamclient loses it: Experimental overwrites it unrecoverably, and **Off deletes it entirely instead of restoring pristine**. Running the Off test as-is would have corrupted the Portal 2 install we just proved works.
> **Fix (`6600914`):** new `backupIfOriginal(file)` mirrors the steam_api `.bak` rule — copies the first (pristine) copy to `<name>.bak` iff the file exists and no backup is there yet — and is called before every steamclient/loader overwrite in Experimental + ColdClient. `removeAddedFiles` now **restores from `.bak` if present** (keeping the `.bak` as the permanent source) and only deletes files with no original (loader exes, `GameOverlayRenderer`, `ColdClientLoader.ini`, our `steam_appid.txt`). Scope note: `bin/win64/` has no original `steamclient64.dll`, so Experimental genuinely *adds* it there (delete-on-restore stays correct); only the x86 `bin/steamclient.dll` collided. A `steam_appid.txt`-backup edit was reverted (games don't ship it → keep it always-added→deleted). Intermediate tier-switch stacking is transient and cleaned at Off.
> **CI:** artifacts-only build **`28684046577`** (`build-artifacts.yml`, ref `feat/steam-goldberg-patcher` tip `6600914`, label steam-logoff-fix).
> **⏳ Next (device, once the build installs):** run Regular→Experimental→ColdClient→Off on Portal 2, verifying each step by md5 against the captured fingerprints (esp. that Off restores `bin/steamclient.dll` to `4505032f` from its new `.bak`). Fingerprints + step-by-step in memory [[project-bannerlator-goldberg-autopatch]].

## 2026-07-03 — 🅿️ Steam login: QR path greyed out; Goldberg becomes the focus (Portal 2 patch-apply device-proven)

> **Decision (user):** username/password login is "working solid and the best" → **grey out the QR-code login for now** so we can push on Goldberg. The QR ~1h logoff-recovery work (Fix A/B, `4c6b202`+`6669771`) stays **in the code, untested/parked — not reverted**; we only disabled the UI entry point.
> **Change (`12166b3`, branch `feat/steam-goldberg-patcher`):** `SteamLoginActivity.kt` ~`:354` — the "Sign in with QR Code" `TextButton` is now `enabled = false`, relabeled **"Sign in with QR Code (temporarily unavailable)"**. UI-only, one-line re-enable. Username/password fields untouched (the primary path). ludashi Kotlin+Java compile GREEN.
> **CI:** artifacts-only build **`28681946617`** (`build-artifacts.yml`, ref `feat/steam-goldberg-patcher` tip `12166b3`, label `steam-logoff-fix`) — 3 flavors, no tag/release. User grabs the APK himself (no device push requested).
> **🎮 Goldberg milestone (device):** user **downloaded + installed Portal 2 (single-player Steam title) via the store, then applied the Goldberg patch successfully.** First real single-player validation of the **patch-apply** step — the exact gate Brawlhalla (online-only, Error 3003) could never clear. ⏳ still to confirm explicitly: patched Portal 2 **boots into gameplay** past the Steam check (apply succeeded; in-game boot not yet reported).
> **Net state:** QR >1h survival test **deprioritized/parked** (not abandoned; playbook preserved). Focus = Goldberg tier ladder + launch-proof. Still on `feat/steam-goldberg-patcher`, **NOT merged**.
>
> **✅✅ UPDATE (same day): Portal 2 patched → BOOTED INTO GAMEPLAY on device.** The full end-to-end Goldberg loop is now proven on real hardware: store download → shared prep → DLL swap (**Regular** tier) → launch past the Steam check → in-game. Clears the last unknown (Brawlhalla could never validate it — online-only Error 3003).
>
> **Where the Goldberg branch stands — code is FEATURE-COMPLETE, only validation + shipping remain** (no TODOs/FIXMEs across the 4 Goldberg files; all 3 tiers + `resolveLaunchExe` + restore + PE-arch-detect implemented, compiling green):
> 1. **Tier-ladder breadth (device):** only **Regular** proven. **Experimental** (adds `steamclient(64).dll`) and **Cold Client Loader** (restores orig api + `steamclient_experimental` loader + generated `ColdClientLoader.ini` + **shortcut Exec repoint** to `steamclient_loader_x64.exe`, wired at shortcut-add `SteamGameDetailActivity.kt:538`) are untested. ColdClient is riskiest — changes the launch command and asks the user to re-add the game to Shortcuts. Needs a title that fails Regular to exercise it.
> 2. **Restore/Off flow (device):** confirm Off restores pristine dlls from `.bak` (+ restores shortcut Exec after ColdClient) — the idempotent restore-then-apply golden rule, not yet round-tripped on device.
> 3. **Merge decision:** branch is **19 commits ahead of `origin/main`** and is a **SUPERSET** — Steam-store M3 restyle + Compose container-picker + dl size/progress dual-bar + Goldberg + parked/greyed QR logoff-recovery Fix A/B. Merging Goldberg = merging all of it. Cleanest = one **superset merge** once tiers proven (store rebuild is the substrate Goldberg sits on); alternative = cherry-pick Goldberg-only (fiddly, shared store files).
> 4. **Release/version:** branch `versionCode 37` == released 2.2.2 → **must bump to vc38+** (monotonic gotcha) before any release. Per the beta-channel strategy, first cut defaults to a **pre-release**.
> 5. **Catalog:** `goldberg.tzst` (`goldberg-v1`, MD5 `BC48B103AD3B067D3ED7CDFDAF728A4A`) already LIVE on winlator-contents — no re-cut needed unless the gbe_fork build changes.
>
> **Recommended next step:** device-test Experimental + ColdClient + Off/restore on a couple of titles → single **superset merge to main** + **vc38 pre-release**. QR path stays parked/greyed, untouched.

## 2026-07-02 — 🐛→✅ Steam: QR-login downloads die ~1h in — fixed (recover from involuntary CM logoff)

> **Symptom (user):** on the QR-login device, Steam depot downloads stop working ~1 hour after login; on a *different* device using **username/password** they run all day, session after session. (This device has only ever used QR — so the correlation is cross-device, not a clean same-device A/B.)
> **Investigation** = native-steam-engineer audit of our `SteamRepository`/`SteamDepotDownloader` vs **GameNative** (`utkarshdalal/GameNative`, `SteamService.kt`), the reference the user asked to compare against.
> **Root cause (code-certain):** `SteamRepository.onLoggedOff` (`:485`) was a **dead-end** — it set `loggedIn=false` and emitted `LoggedOut` with **no reconnect and no re-logon**, unlike `onDisconnected` (`:445`) which auto-recovers a socket drop. Depot downloads authenticate purely over the live CM session (manifest request codes, depot keys, CDN tokens — `SteamDepotDownloader.kt:256-371`), **not** a WebAPI bearer. So a clean mid-session CM **LoggedOff** (`EResult.Expired` ~1h into a QR-approved session; password sessions last longer or drop as a *recoverable* Disconnect) permanently stranded the session → in-flight download stalled → surfaced a bogus **"Unknown error."**
> **Not the cause (ruled out):** `getAccessToken()` (`:892`) returns the refresh token ("doubles as bearer") but has **zero callers** — dead code, not in the download path. Both auth managers mint **identical SteamClient-audience** tokens (`persistentSession=true`), so QR-vs-password is **which callback fires**, not a token-audience misconfig. Our `LogOnDetails.setAccessToken(refreshToken)` pattern **matches GameNative** — correct, not misused.
> **Verdict:** we were **MISSING recovery, not misusing an API.** GameNative's `onLoggedOff`→`reconnect()` (`SteamService.kt:3940-3970`) heals *both* login types with **no proactive token renewal** — pure reconnect+relogin from the stored refresh token.
>
> **Fix (branch `feat/steam-goldberg-patcher`, `4c6b202` + follow-up; ludashi Kotlin+Java compile GREEN):**
> - **A — `SteamRepository.java` (the fix):** `onLoggedOff` now recovers an involuntary logoff by forcing a reconnect+relogin. `forceReconnect` flag lets `onDisconnected` proceed even though a self-initiated `disconnect()` reports `userInitiated=true` (the gotcha). Bounded by `logoffRecoveryAttempts < MAX_LOGOFF_RECOVERY(3)` (reset on `LoggedOn`) so a dead token can't loop. `loggingOut` flag (set by `logout()`, cleared on login/`saveSession`) keeps an intentional sign-out from being "recovered." `LoggedInElsewhere`/`LogonSessionReplaced` treated as terminal.
> - **B — `SteamDepotDownloader.kt`:** `onDownloadFailed` now **defers** to the `finally` block, which awaits `ensureLoggedIn(30s)` and **retries the install once as a resume** (`attempt` param, `MAX_SESSION_RETRIES=2`) before surfacing failure — so a mid-download logoff reuses already-downloaded files instead of restarting. Plus `initDebugLog(truncate = attempt == 0)` so the retry **appends** rather than wiping `steam_debug.txt` — the failure+recovery narrative survives for on-device diagnosis.
> - **C/D deliberately deferred:** optional proactive `generateAccessTokenForApp(refreshToken, allowRenewal=true)` renewal, and deleting the dead `getAccessToken()` — GameNative proves A+B suffice.
>
> **CI:** artifacts-only build **`28625813606`** (`build-artifacts.yml`, ref `feat/steam-goldberg-patcher`, label `steam-logoff-fix`) — the installable APK with the fix.
> **Bridge note:** root bridge daemon (`127.0.0.1:8765`) was alive but this session's PRoot lacked the (boot-rotated) token + Termux-home client; recovered by writing the user-supplied token and speaking the raw `<token>\n<verb>\n` protocol directly (bare verbs `exec`/`ping`/`cat`, not the `--exec` client form). No historical logs survived to confirm the `EResult` (ring buffer aged out, no `steam_debug.txt`, app not running).
> **⏳ GATE (device):** user will download + test the new build. Confirm a fresh **QR login + large download survives past ~1h** — watch `steam_debug.txt` / logcat `SteamRepo` for `Involuntary logoff (Expired) → forcing reconnect+relogin` then a resumed completion. Fix is correct regardless of the exact EResult.

## 2026-07-01 — 🏁 RELEASED: Bannerlator 2.2.2 (stable, versionCode 37)

> **GitHub release `2.2.2`** — tag `2.2.2` at `97c0e44`, **prerelease=false / make_latest** (now the Latest release), 3 flavor APKs + `update.json` reporting **versionCode 37 / versionName 2.2.2**. Built by `release.yml` run **`28520346738`** (success, from the main vc37 commit). **vc37 > pre1 vc36 > stable-2.2 vc35** so the in-app updater offers 2.2.2 to both stable and beta users.
> **What shipped (the four areas previously staged on main since 2.2):** in-game ReShade Tier 1 (per-game multi-effect switching, on-demand catalog, typed live controls, pause-box fix); vkBasalt version-aware `.so` re-extraction (existing containers auto-refresh the ReShade layer on next launch); white-accent bundle (#46 control accent + #45 container-creation orphan-dir + white/dark app-accent contrast); FPS-limiter shortcut-persist (#46).
> **Release description** hand-set via `gh release edit --notes-file` to match the 2.2 layout (logo → What's New → Downloads → updating note → thanks) — the workflow's auto-changelog body was overwritten. **README** updated on main (`d837036`): new "What's New in 2.2.2" section (old 2.2 notes moved into a `<details>`), version line → 2.2.2/vc37, and the **ReShade multi-select flat-screen warning in 3 places** (What's New, ReShade feature bullet, and the troubleshooting callout): stacking too many effects can prevent a game from starting (flat/blank screen) → uncheck effects one at a time until it boots.
> **⚠️ Watch item:** the vkBasalt version-aware extraction (`f3a6340`) was CI-green but never independently device-proven — shipped on faith; watch for "existing container didn't pick up the new ReShade layer" reports.

---

## 2026-07-01 — 📦 RELEASE-CHANNEL STATE + artifacts-only test build of `main`

> **Artifacts-only build dispatched** — `build-artifacts.yml` run **`28518700499`**, ref `main` tip `20fd2da` (vc36/2.2.1), label `2.2.1-main-test`, 3 flavors (ludashi/pubg/standard), **NO tag, NO release**. User downloads the APKs to device-test the staged stack; then has "a few things to test and add" before cutting the next release.
> **Channel state (measured 2026-07-01):**
> - **Stable** = `2.2` / vc35 (all users).
> - **Beta (2.2.1-pre1)** = update.json **vc36** = **2.2 + in-game rail scroll ONLY.** ⚠️ CORRECTION: ReShade Tier 1 is **not** in the beta — it merged to main (`d166869`, 2026-07-01 00:19 EDT) ~4.5h *after* pre1 published (2026-06-30 19:45 EDT), and pre1 was built from the `fix/ingame-rail-scroll` branch before Tier 1 landed. (The git tag `2.2.1-pre1` sits loosely at a vc35 docs commit `9f51ed7`; trust the release's update.json vc36, not the tag.)
> - **Staged on `main` (vc36) but released to NOBODY — 4 areas:** (1) ReShade Tier 1 `d166869`; (2) vkBasalt version-aware `extra_libs`/`.so` re-extraction `f3a6340` (makes Tier 1 work for existing users — ships with #1; NOT device-proven, needs an old-container upgrade check); (3) white-accent bundle `0bfeebd` (#46 control accent + #45 container-creation + white/dark app-accent, device-proven); (4) FPS-limiter shortcut-persist `12a4fc8` (#46, device-proven). #46 + #45 both CLOSED.
> **⚠️ Monotonic gotcha:** `main` vc36 == pre1 vc36, so the next pre-release/stable **must bump to vc37+** or the updater won't offer it to pre1 testers.

## 2026-07-01 — 🏁 DEVICE-PROVEN + MERGED: #46 FPS-limiter-resets fix — persist in-game toggle to the owning shortcut

> **✅ DEVICE-PROVEN** (user: "installed and tested it, works and remembers now") **+ MERGED to `main`** in `12a4fc8` (`--no-ff` of `8476b60`, `71be697..12a4fc8`), branch `fix/fps-limiter-shortcut-persist` deleted. CI code build `3d59293` / run **`28516599378`** GREEN (13m). **Issue #46 FULLY CLOSED** (both halves — white virtual-control color + this FPS reset — resolved). Version stayed vc36/2.2.1 (accumulate on main, no bump). Fixes the diagnosis in the entry below.
> **Fix (mirror the ReShade Bug A owner-discriminator fix — write-target == read-source), all in `XServerDisplayActivity.java` (+29/−5):**
> 1. `onFpsLimitChange` (`:603-611`): when `shortcut != null`, write `fpsLimiterEnabled` (+`fpsLimiterValue` when > 0) back to the **shortcut** and `shortcut.saveData()` (`Shortcut.java:153/163`); else the container write as before.
> 2. New `resolvedFpsLimiterValue()` mirroring `resolvedFpsLimiterEnabled()` (parseInt with container fallback, null-safe pattern copied from `resolvedManualRefreshRate()`).
> 3. Used the resolver at **both** value read sites so value reads from the same owner it's written to: the drawer value seed (`:795`) and the launch-time `applyFpsLimit(... ? resolvedFpsLimiterValue() : 0)` (was `:2159`, which had paired the shortcut-aware enabled resolver with the raw `container.getFpsLimiterValue()`).
> **Scope:** container-only (no-shortcut) launches unchanged; `matchRefreshRate`/`manualRefreshRate`/`frameGen` untouched (not shortcut-stamped or not editable in-game). Backward-compatible: a shortcut with no `fpsLimiterValue` extra falls back to the container value.
> **Hygiene note:** an initial `git add -A` accidentally staged two `.claude/worktrees/` embedded-repo gitlinks; amended out and added `.gitignore` `.claude/worktrees/` (force-pushed `d5f2b22`→`3d59293`).
> **▶️ Device-retest gate (then comment + close #46):** launch a game via its shortcut → toggle the FPS limiter in-game (test both on→off and off→on, and a cap-value change) → quit → relaunch via the same shortcut → the limiter state + value hold. Confirm a container-only launch still persists, and that a second game's shortcut is unaffected (per-game isolation). No merge / no version bump without user go (accumulate on main per the beta-channel workflow).

---

## 2026-07-01 — 🔎 ROOT-CAUSE CONFIRMED (not yet coded): #46's 2nd complaint "FPS limit resets every time you close a game" = shortcut-vs-container owner mismatch

> **Status: DIAGNOSED, fix planned, NOT implemented/branched.** Code-traced, not device-repro'd yet. This is the open half of issue #46 (Noname267), the same class of bug as ReShade Tier-1 **Bug A** (write-target ≠ read-source across the shortcut/container owner boundary).
> **Trigger — hits ~EVERY shortcut-launched game:** `ShortcutsScreen.kt:1201` stamps an `fpsLimiterEnabled` extra onto every shortcut it saves (always `"1"`/`"0"`, never null), so every game launched from a shortcut/game-entry carries it.
> **The asymmetry:**
> - **READ (launch seed):** `resolvedFpsLimiterEnabled()` (`XServerDisplayActivity.java:3597-3602`) returns `shortcut.getExtra("fpsLimiterEnabled", <container default>)` when `shortcut != null` — i.e. reads the SHORTCUT.
> - **WRITE (in-game toggle):** `onFpsLimitChange` (`:603-611`) commits **only** to `container.setFpsLimiterEnabled(limOn)` / `container.setFpsLimiterValue(limitVal)` + `container.saveData()` — there is NO shortcut branch.
> **⇒** an in-game limiter on/off change is never written back to the owning shortcut, so the next launch re-seeds from the stale shortcut extra and the toggle reverts → "resets every time you close a game." (The *value* seed `:795` / write `:609` both use the container so `fpsLimiterValue` itself survives — but the on/off toggle reverting moots it.)
> **The "and others" part is mostly benign:** `matchRefreshRate` / `manualRefreshRate` are NOT stamped onto shortcuts by the editor, so their resolvers (`:3606`, `:3616`) fall back to the container and read==write (no bug). `frameGenEngine` IS stamped (`:1200`) and read shortcut-aware (`:3527`) but the engine isn't editable in-game (only FG on/off + multiplier are, and those persist container↔container). So the single real, reproducible offender is the **FPS-limiter enable toggle** — exactly the setting the reporter named.
> **FIX PLAN (mirror the ReShade Bug A fix — make write-target == read-source; `Shortcut.java:153/163` already exposes `putExtra()` + `saveData()`):**
> 1. In `onFpsLimitChange` (`:603-611`): if `shortcut != null`, write `fpsLimiterEnabled` (+`fpsLimiterValue`) back to the **shortcut** and `shortcut.saveData()`; else keep the current container write.
> 2. Add `resolvedFpsLimiterValue()` mirroring `resolvedFpsLimiterEnabled()` and use it at the value seed (`:795`) so the value is read from the same owner it's written to.
> **Proposed branch** `fix/fps-limiter-shortcut-persist`. **Device retest** = toggle the limiter in-game → quit → relaunch via that game's shortcut → limiter state holds (both on→off and off→on); confirm container-only (no-shortcut) launches still persist. Then comment + close #46. No merge/version bump without user go.

## 2026-07-01 — 🏁 MERGED TO MAIN: #46 white virtual-control accent + #45 container-creation orphan-dir + white/dark app-accent contrast

> **Merge `0bfeebd`** (`--no-ff`, `f3a6340..0bfeebd`), branch `fix/white-accent-and-container-creation` deleted (local + remote). Branch tip `116ef9e` CI-green (run **`28511850270`**, headSha-verified). This adds one commit beyond the earlier checkpoint — `116ef9e` "symmetric on-accent contrast": a **dark** custom accent previously fell through to the preset's baked `onPrimary` (itself dark on Monochrome/Phosphor/Royal Gold/Frost → dark-on-dark glyphs), now mirrors the light-accent guard (derive on-accent from luminance for ANY custom accent; built-in presets keep their designed `onPrimary` → default byte-identical). The white-app-accent follow-up is now **DEVICE-CONFIRMED** by the user ("works well").
> **Version left at vc36 / 2.2.1** (same as main's prior rail-scroll + vkBasalt pre-release). Per the opt-in beta-channel workflow, **NO release cut and NO versionCode bump** — the user chose to let fixes keep accumulating on `main` until there's enough for a pre-release (pre2, vc37) or a stable push. ⚠️ Testers already on vc36 won't be offered a new build until the versionCode bumps to 37+.
> **Issues closed out:** #45 commented + **CLOSED (completed)** pointing at fix `b69c0e7` / merge `0bfeebd`. #46 commented crediting the color fixes (`b69c0e7` + `b1b2cc7` + `116ef9e` / merge `0bfeebd`) but **LEFT OPEN** to track its second, unaddressed complaint — "limit fps and others reset every time you close a game" — for which the reporter was asked for repro steps (which setting, per-game vs container default, GL vs Vulkan). That FPS-reset bug was deliberately NOT in this branch (AMA bot's `state.reset()` theory is a misdiagnosis; real suspect = shortcut-vs-container owner mismatch, needs a repro).

---

## 2026-07-01 — Two user-reported bugs: white virtual-control accent (#46) + container creation bricked by orphan shortcut dir (#45), plus white-app-accent contrast follow-up — ✅ CODE DONE, CI building (branch `fix/white-accent-and-container-creation`, NOT merged) [SUPERSEDED — see MERGED entry above]

> **Source:** GitHub issues #46 ("custom colors… white doesn't apply to virtual controls, becomes blue") and #45 ("Add shortcut issue that can break container creation"). The AMA bot had diagnosed both but never pushed (no CI write creds); all three fixes below are independently code-verified against source, not taken on the bot's word.
> **Branch `fix/white-accent-and-container-creation`** off `main`. Commit 1 `b69c0e7` (#46 control + #45), CI run **`28506368680` ✅GREEN** (headSha == tip, 3 flavors). Commit 2 `b1b2cc7` (white-app-accent follow-up), CI run **`28508536976`** dispatched (headSha verified == tip; result pending at checkpoint). NOT merged, version un-bumped (35/2.2), no tag.
>
> **#46 — white virtual controls rendered as the default blue — FIXED (`ControlElement.java:728`).** The in-game GAMEHUB touch-control style gated its accent path on `boolean hasAccent = accent != -1`, but `resolveAccentColor()` → `InputControlsView.getAccentColor()` always returns a full-opacity ARGB (`0xff000000 | rgb`), so it can never legitimately be a `-1` "no accent" sentinel — **except pure white, which IS `0xFFFFFFFF` == `-1` as a signed int** → `hasAccent=false` → fell back to the hardcoded blue. Fix = `hasAccent = true` (accent is always live; the file's own comment already said "Never -1 now"). ✅ **DEVICE-CONFIRMED by user** (white controls now render white).
>
> **#45 — creating a container silently fails permanently after importing a shortcut for a deleted container — FIXED (`ContainerManager.java` + `ShortcutsViewModel.kt`).** Repro: create container → launch it (registers it in the Shortcuts screen's `ContainerManager`) → delete it → the `+` add-shortcut picker still lists the dead container → importing to it calls `getDesktopDir().mkdirs()` which **recreates** `xuser-<id>/` → the next `createContainer()` reuses that id, `mkdirs()` returns false (dir exists) → returns null → screen closes silently, and stays broken for ALL future creations. Fix, two parts: (1) `createContainer()` — before `mkdirs()`, if the target dir already exists, delete it when it's an orphan (no `.container` config) else bail as a real id collision; (2) `ShortcutsViewModel` — new `liveContainers()` filters `manager.getContainers()` to those whose `.container` file exists on disk, routed through `containers()`, `importShortcut()`, `cloneToContainer()`, `renameImportedShortcut()` so stale entries never appear in the picker or reach the filesystem (indices stay consistent because every call site uses the same filtered list). ✅ **DEVICE-CONFIRMED by user** (deleted container no longer shows in the add-game/shortcut picker).
>
> **Follow-up (user-found in the same test) — a WHITE APP THEME accent made on-accent buttons render solid white — FIXED (`ThemePreset.kt` + 3 call sites).** Separate path from the in-game control fix: out-of-game Compose UI. Root cause in `ThemePreset.toColorScheme()/toLightColorScheme()` — `val accent = accentOverride ?: primary` set `primary` to the custom white accent but kept the preset's baked `onPrimary` (white on the AMOLED base) → **white content on a now-white primary**. Fix = when a **light custom accent** is supplied (`accentOverride != null && accentOverride.luminance() > 0.5f`) derive a dark on-accent color for `onPrimary`/`onSecondary`; built-in presets and dark custom accents keep their designed `onPrimary`, so **default AMOLED (no override, onPrimary already white) stays byte-identical**. Also routed the hardcoded `Color.White` foregrounds on primary-backed buttons through `colorScheme.onPrimary`: the `+` FAB (`ContainersScreen.kt:185`), the container **Play** button (`:381`), the Saves `+` FAB (`SavesScreen.kt`), and the "NEW" badge (`AppDrawer.kt`) — the last two are the same bug and would also vanish under a white accent. ⏳ **NOT yet device-tested** (diagnosed from the user's description + source; device bridge was down this session — no adb/8765). New import `androidx.compose.ui.graphics.luminance`.
>
> **▶️ REMAINING:** device-retest the white-app-accent follow-up (set theme accent to white → `+`/Play/Saves-`+`/NEW badge show dark icon/text, not solid white; in-game white controls + #45 still hold); then merge decision. Per the opt-in beta-channel workflow these two user-reported fixes are a natural pre-release candidate once fully device-verified. No merge/tag/version-bump without explicit user go. **Not touched:** #46's second complaint ("FPS limit resets every time you close a game") — the AMA bot's `state.reset()` theory is a misdiagnosis (reset at `:506` runs BEFORE the container seed at `:794-795`; in-game changes already write back via `onFpsLimitChange`); real suspect is the same shortcut-vs-container owner mismatch as ReShade Bug A — needs a repro before coding, deliberately left out of this branch.

---

## 2026-07-01 — vkBasalt layer VERSION-AWARE EXTRACTION — existing containers get the updated `extra_libs.tzst` on app-update — ✅ CODE DONE (branch `fix/vkbasalt-version-aware-extraction`, NOT merged)

> **Why:** the layer-extraction gate in `XServerDisplayActivity.java` re-extracted `graphics_driver/extra_libs.tzst` (which carries the vkBasalt layer `libvkbasalt.so`) ONLY when the container was brand-new (`firstTimeBoot`) or the `.so` was TOTALLY ABSENT. It had no "installed `.so` is OUTDATED" case, so a user updating from 2.1.1 (old bundled `.so`) to 2.2.1 who relaunched an EXISTING container kept the stale shared-imagefs `.so` → the new Tier-1 ReShade per-effect features (and CAS/DLS sharpness) silently no-op'd. Required before the 2.2.1 stable cut.
> **Fix — a third trigger + a persisted version marker.** New constant `EXTRA_LIBS_VERSION = 2` (`XServerDisplayActivity.java:240`, near the other constants; MUST be bumped whenever `app/src/main/assets/graphics_driver/extra_libs.tzst` is repacked). Marker FILE (not SharedPreferences, so a reinstall-imagefs resets it consistently) at `imageFs.getLibDir()/.extra_libs_version` holding the int; missing/unparseable ⇒ `-1`. Restructured gate (`~:2976-2991`): `firstTimeBoot` still extracts BOTH `layers.tzst` + `extra_libs.tzst` then writes the marker; otherwise `!vkBasaltSo.exists() || installedVer != EXTRA_LIBS_VERSION` ⇒ extract `extra_libs.tzst` then write the marker. All three successful-extract paths converge the marker to `EXTRA_LIBS_VERSION` (extracts once per app-upgrade). Helpers `readExtraLibsVersion()`/`writeExtraLibsVersion()` (`~:2886`/`:2900`). Log.d mirrors existing style, names which trigger fired.
> **Existing installs have NO marker ⇒ `-1` ⇒ mismatch ⇒ re-extract on first launch after updating** — so every pre-existing container picks up the patched Tier-1 `libvkbasalt.so` (md5 `3129127c098dcaa7704cf264ef47f157`, 1852976 B — already the one in `extra_libs.tzst` on main).
> **DATA-SAFETY (unchanged):** extraction stays a pure additive per-entry overwrite to `imageFs.getRootDir()`; NO delete/clean step added; target unchanged. Verified `extra_libs.tzst` = ONLY `usr/lib/*.so` (libvkbasalt/libvulkan_freedreno/libbcn_layer) + `usr/share/vulkan/*` (icd.d + implicit_layer.d manifests) — NO home/drive_c/user data.
> **NOT bumped:** app versionCode/versionName stay 35/2.2 (the bump lives on another branch). `extra_libs.tzst` NOT modified. No merge/tag.
> **On-device verification recipe:** on a device that already has an EXISTING container built with the OLD `.so`, install the 2.2.1 build over it, relaunch that container (do NOT create a new one) → `imageFs` `usr/lib/libvkbasalt.so` md5 == `3129127c098dcaa7704cf264ef47f157`, `.extra_libs_version` == `2`, and a Tier-1 per-effect toggle (Solo bypass / per-effect enable) takes effect live.

## 2026-06-30 — In-game ReShade effect SWITCHING — Tier 1 (multi-effect loadout + per-effect enable gate) — 🏁 FULLY DEVICE-PROVEN + MERGED TO MAIN 2026-07-01 (merge `d166869`)

> 🏁 **STATUS 2026-07-01 — TIER 1 DONE, DEVICE-PROVEN END-TO-END (ludashi).** Gates 1–8 device-verified earlier; then two device-found bugs were fixed and both confirmed on-device on fix build **CI `28492221848`** (branch `feat/reshade-multi-effect-switch` tip **`82c6799`**, headSha `82c67995…` == branch tip, +82/−16 across 3 files, `extra_libs.tzst`/patched .so untouched = app-side only):
> - **BUG A — per-game persistence (commit `801fee9`): FIXED + user-confirmed.** In-game changes to loadout/order, Solo/Stack, per-effect enabled, sliders, and master on/off now persist to the game's **shortcut** and restore on cold relaunch. Root cause = persist path and read path used different owner discriminators (`applyReshadeLive` wrote to the shortcut whenever non-null, but `resolveReshade` reads the shortcut only when it *owns* reshade, else the container) → container-configured reshade launched via a shortcut reverted; master on/off was never persisted at all. Fix = one shared `shortcutOwnsReshade()` (write-target == read-source) + persisted `reshadeMasterEnabled`. Disk-flush verified: each in-game change-commit synchronously rewrites the shortcut `.desktop` (`Shortcut.saveData()` → `FileUtils.writeString`, `XServerDisplayActivity.java:1528`; container branch `container.saveData()` `:1534`), sliders debounced to release — so quitting/killing the game cannot lose changes.
> - **BUG B — pause box on the freeze (commit `82c6799`): FIXED + user-confirmed ("pause and resume now shows up and works correctly").** Root cause = z-order: `PauseBoxOverlay` was an inline `Box` inside the dialog-host ComposeView, which the game SurfaceView (Vulkan/GL + ASR scanout) composites above → hidden on the frozen frame. Fix = host the pill in `androidx.compose.ui.window.Dialog` (own top-level window above the game surface), no dim scrim, non-modal so the drawer stays usable during a Live-preview-OFF freeze; tap → resume.
> ✅ **MERGED to main 2026-07-01** (`d166869`, --no-ff of `feat/reshade-multi-effect-switch` tip `cd716cd`; pushed `9f51ed7..d166869`; version un-bumped 35/2.2, no tag/release). ▶️ **REMAINING (all user-gated / non-functional):** (2) version-aware-extraction fix (re-extract `extra_libs.tzst` when the bundled .so hash differs, so existing containers get the patched layer — needed before release); (3) codegen sweep to prune non-compiling catalog effects; (4) release notes (credits DadSchoorse / Pipetto / StevenMXZ); (5) Tier 2 (live add-from-catalog via on-device recompile). No merge/tag/version-bump without explicit user go.

**Goal (user):** select MULTIPLE ReShade effects per game and **toggle between them LIVE in-game** — Solo (A/B one at a time) or Stack (layered) — with auto-generated per-effect sliders. Built on top of the merged Step 3 stack. Baseline was single-effect only (`Container.getReshadeEffect()` one string, conf `effects=<reshade>:cas`). Two tiers agreed: **Tier 1 = pre-compiled loadout with an instant per-effect enable gate (this entry)**; Tier 2 = live "add from catalog" via on-device recompile (later).

- **LOCKED conf-key contract** (app emits / patch reads, exact): `effects = e1:e2:…:en:cas`; per effect `<ei> = <fxPath>`; uniforms `<ei>_<uniform>[_c] = value` (unchanged `formatUniformLine`); **NEW `<ei>_enabled = 0|1`** (default 1 = active); global master stays `enableOnLaunch`. effectKey = `name→[^A-Za-z0-9_]→_` lowercased.
- **Native patch** — branch `feat/reshade-mes-patch` (`83930e2`), vkBasalt CI `28488420505` ✅GREEN. Extended `patches/vkbasalt-reshade-livereload.patch` (+219/−12): each `ReshadeEffect` reads `<name>_enabled` on construct + on the existing present-hook mtime reload; a disabled effect does an **identity image-copy passthrough** (reuses the proven `TransferEffect` barrier/`vkCmdCopyImage`/layout path — input `PRESENT_SRC→TRANSFER_SRC`, output `UNDEFINED→TRANSFER_DST`, copy, both back to `PRESENT_SRC`) so the ping-pong chain stays valid and downstream/present see the pre-effect frame. Gate flip → `QueueWaitIdle` + re-record `commandBuffersEffect` (one-frame hitch **only** on toggle, never per-frame). Base `Effect::enabled=true` so CAS/builtins are never gated; global `presentEffect`/`enableOnLaunch` orthogonal. Stripped patched `libvkbasalt.so` md5 `3129127c098dcaa7704cf264ef47f157` (1852976 B).
- **App loadout** — branch `feat/reshade-multi-effect-switch`, app work commit `fc3ce45`. android-app-engineer added: `reshade/ReshadeLoadout.java` (parse/serialize + **migration** old single-effect → 1-entry Solo loadout, `paramsForEffect`, `enforceSolo`), `ui/ReshadeLoadoutItem.kt`, `ui/screens/ReshadeLoadoutEditor.kt` (`ReshadeLoadoutState` + editor: mode switch, high-count hint, per-effect typed controls); `Container.java` `reshadeLoadout`/`reshadeMode` (legacy getters kept); `XServerDisplayActivity` `writeVkBasaltConfig` rewritten to iterate the loadout (emits the contract incl. `<ei>_enabled` + colon-joined texture/include paths; live apply skips folder re-staging), `resolveReshade()` = shortcut owns reshade as a **unit** (loadout+mode+params) else container; `XServerDialogState.kt` new `ReshadeApplyCallback(masterEnabled, mode, items)`; `XServerDrawer.kt` ReShade tab = master toggle + Solo/Stack + per-effect radio(solo)/checkbox(stack) + collapsible typed controls + per-effect Reset; `ReshadeCatalogPicker.kt` now **multi-select** (download-on-demand preserved); `ContainerDetail*`/`ShortcutsScreen` wired. Reorder not implemented (order = selection order).
- ⚠️ **Process catch — a FALSE CI PASS was corrected.** The app agent's first "CI green `28489017067`" actually built headSha `9f51ed7` (branch **base**, no Tier-1 code): it committed `fc3ce45` to a stray **local `main`** and never pushed to the feature branch, and `main.yml` ("Any branch compilation") is **workflow_dispatch-only**, building whatever the ref tip is at dispatch. Fixed: moved `feat/reshade-multi-effect-switch` → `fc3ce45` (clean; its parent IS the base), deleted the stray `main`. **Rule reaffirmed: verify the CI run's `headSha` == the intended commit, and push to the ref BEFORE `gh workflow run main.yml --ref <branch>`.**
- **Integration + REAL CI green:** repacked the patched `.so` into `app/src/main/assets/graphics_driver/extra_libs.tzst` (14 entries preserved, `vkBasalt.json` manifest unchanged) + copied the updated patch → commit **`cd1187e`** (pushed); dispatched `main.yml --ref feat/reshade-multi-effect-switch` → run **`28489656349` ✅GREEN** (`build: success`, headSha `cd1187e` verified). So the loadout + enable-gate `.so` genuinely compile in CI (not the earlier wrong-SHA run).
- **✅ Pause/preview UX DONE + INTEGRATED** — branch `feat/reshade-pause-pulse` (`c5cc755`, off `cd1187e`), **CI `28490017156` ✅GREEN (headSha c5cc755 verified, all 3 flavors `assembleRelease`)**. Because it branched off `cd1187e`, that one green build = the ENTIRE Tier 1 stack (loadout + integrated enable-gate `.so` + pause). Cherry-picked onto the feature branch → tip **`ab70dca`** (`git diff c5cc755 HEAD` = only PROGRESS_LOG differs). Impl: `PresentExtension` `PresentListener` (one fire per real present); `pulseReshadePreview()` = register listener + SIGCONT → on the 2nd present (`RESHADE_PULSE_TARGET_PRESENTS=2`) SIGSTOP, `postDelayed` 80ms (`RESHADE_PULSE_FALLBACK_MS`) fallback if the game isn't presenting, `AtomicBoolean`/`reshadePulseInProgress` guard so refreeze fires once and serializes; `setPausedState(boolean)` = single source of truth (SIGSTOP/SIGCONT + mirrors drawer `setIsPaused` + dialog `setPaused`, clears `reshadePreviewPaused` on resume); `PauseBoxOverlay.kt` (centered pill, only the pill `clickable`) hosted in the existing full-size dialog-host ComposeView above the SurfaceView, tap→`onRequestResume`; `onResume`/`exit()` clear-and-resume so teardown can't hang on a suspended guest. "Live preview" toggle itself doesn't route through `apply()` so opening the tab never freezes. **3 flavor APKs downloaded from run 28490017156 → `/home/claude-user/scratchpad/reshade-tier1-apk/{standard,ludashi,pubg}-debug/` (standard = `com.winlator.banner`).**
- 🚨 **DEVICE-TEST SETUP GOTCHA + PRE-RELEASE FOLLOW-UP:** the layer re-extraction (`XServerDisplayActivity.java:2929-2937`) re-extracts `extra_libs.tzst` only on `firstTimeBoot` OR when `libvkbasalt.so` is **absent** — it does NOT replace an **out-of-date** .so. So containers that already have the OLD libvkbasalt.so keep it and silently ignore `<ei>_enabled` (per-effect toggle won't bypass; the multi-effect chain still compiles). ⇒ **DEVICE TEST ON A FRESH CONTAINER** (firstTimeBoot extracts the new md5 `3129127…` .so). **REQUIRED FIX before release** (affects all existing users): make extraction **version-aware** — re-extract when the bundled .so differs (store a version/hash marker or bump on appVersion change), else Tier 1 no-ops on every pre-existing container.
- **(orig plan) Pause/preview UX (co-designed with user):** a persisted **"Live preview"** toggle in the ReShade tab (default OFF). **OFF = freeze-frame + pulse** — enter preview-pause on the first committed change (effect toggle, or slider **release**) via SIGSTOP; each committed change SIGCONT → count **1–2 real presents** (via `PresentExtension`) → SIGSTOP, so the change renders and the native re-record hitch is hidden inside the pulse; a compact **center pause-box** overlay (tap = full resume) shown while frozen, also generalised to normal manual Pause; sliders pulse on release only (not per-tick). **ON = game keeps running** (continuous live slider preview + ~1-frame toggle blip, no box). Reuses `ProcessHelper.pause/resumeAllWineProcesses` (SIGSTOP/SIGCONT), `isPaused`, `onPauseResume`, `PresentExtension`.
  - *Why not "re-present one frozen frame forever" (user idea):* vkBasalt is a **passive** layer (runs only on the game's present); SIGSTOP freezes the presenting thread (may hold the `VkQueue` → external-sync/deadlock if we drive present from outside); and our host compositor re-blitting shows effects already **baked** into the handed-off buffer. A true frozen live-preview would need vkBasalt to **self-drive** a present loop on a cached pre-effect frame, or a **game-clock freeze** (intercept QPC/timeGetTime) — both heavy/fragile. The pulse is the safe ~95% (1–2 frames ≈ the same moment). Kept as a possible future enhancement if the pulse feels insufficient on-device.
- ▶️ **NEXT = DEVICE TEST** (the real gate; branch tip `ab70dca`, APK ready). On a **FRESH container** (see gotcha above), on a **Vulkan/DXVK** title: (1) pre-launch multi-select loadout in shortcut + container settings; (2) in-game ReShade tab lists the loadout, Solo=radio / Stack=checkbox toggle switches effects LIVE; (3) per-effect sliders live-tune; (4) Live-preview OFF → first change freezes + center pause-box, toggle/slider-release pulses 1–2 frames to reveal, tap box resumes; (5) Live-preview ON → game keeps running, continuous slider preview + ~1-frame toggle blip, no box; (6) master on/off; (7) migration: an existing single-effect profile loads as a 1-entry Solo loadout; (8) no teardown hang when exiting while frozen. Then: version-aware-extraction fix, merge decision, Tier 2 (live add-from-catalog + pause-assisted recompile). **No merge / no release / no version bump without user go.**

## 2026-06-30 — In-game drawer left icon-rail now scrolls on short screens + 2.2.1 pre-release 1

**Bug (Discord, "TAR - OnePlus 15 1TB - A840 gpu"):** in the in-game side menu the left vertical **icon rail** (Graphics / FPS / ReShade / Controls / Advanced … Task-Manager / Pause / **Exit**) didn't all fit; the user "can't go all the way down to close the game" — the bottom **Exit** button overflowed off-screen with no way to scroll.

**Cause:** the rail was a `fillMaxHeight` `Column` distributing icons with three `Spacer(Modifier.weight(1f))`. On a short drawer height the weight spacers collapse to 0 and the bottom group overflows, unreachable (no scroll). `XServerDrawer.kt:133`.

**Fix (`XServerDrawer.kt`):** wrapped the rail in `BoxWithConstraints` + `verticalScroll`. Content sits in a `Column` with `heightIn(min = maxHeight)` + `Arrangement.SpaceEvenly` over two group-columns (top tabs / bottom TM+Pause+Exit). `SpaceEvenly` reproduces the **exact** three-equal-gap distributed look when it fits, and **stacks + scrolls** when it doesn't, so Exit is always reachable. (`weight()` can't be used inside `verticalScroll` — infinite height — hence `SpaceEvenly`.) Added imports `BoxWithConstraints`, `heightIn`.

**Release:** branch `fix/ingame-rail-scroll`. Bumped `versionCode` 35→36, `versionName` "2.2"→"2.2.1" so the in-app updater flags it. Cutting **2.2.1 Pre-release 1** via `release.yml` (`make_prerelease=true`) — publishes signed release APKs + `update.json` as a GitHub **pre-release**; `make_latest=false` so the **stable `latest` channel is untouched**. Only users who enabled **Settings → "Include pre-releases"** (`update_include_prereleases`, default off) get offered it (by design). NOT merged to main; awaiting on-device confirmation that the rail scrolls + Exit reachable on the OnePlus 15. **✅ DEVICE-VERIFIED by an online user 2026-07-01; merged to main.**

## 2026-06-30 — Release 2.2 description rewritten + README accuracy pass + UI-rewrite explainer

**Docs/release only — no code.** Rewrote the **2.2 GitHub release** body (was the auto-generated commit-table) into the established release layout (centered logo → title → bold summary → `✨ What's New` emoji sections → Downloads table → updating note → thanks), covering the real 2.2 scope: themeable interface (app + in-game drawer), 9 new presets (16 total, AMOLED still default), per-game on-screen control colours, File Manager Favorites, rebuilt controller-binding screen, in-game Task Manager (New Task on Vulkan/Native + cards), consistency/readability. Updating note states 2.2 is **app-side only — no ImageFS reinstall**.

- **README:** the bump commit `2ccfda8` had already rewritten it accurately; verified preset names against `ThemePreset.kt` (16 named + Custom) and Favorites labels against `FileManagerScreen.kt:describeLocation` (Internal / SD card / Drive C: / Drive Z:). One fix pushed (`6355d0e`): controls toggle is labelled **"Follow app theme"** (`XServerDrawer.kt:1611`), README said "Follow theme".
- **NEW: "Under the hood — the UI rewrite" section added to the 2.2 release** at user request — what kind of Compose, what's converted, Compose-vs-XML/Java proportion. **Measured facts (for future reference):**
  - **Stack** = Jetpack Compose + **Material 3**, Kotlin, **single-Activity** `MainActivity` + **Navigation-Compose** (`compose-bom:2024.02.00`, `navigation-compose:2.7.6`, `activity-compose:1.8.2`), **Hilt**. ~**237 `@Composable`** across ~**62 Compose files** / **91 .kt** files (~**32k** Kotlin LOC).
  - **Out-of-game app = 100% Compose, no XML screens left.** All drawer destinations are Compose routes (`Screen.kt`): Containers, ContainerDetail, Games/Shortcuts, Contents, InputControls, AdrenoTools, Saves, FileManager, Settings, Appearance, Splash. All 4 storefronts (GOG/Epic/Amazon/Steam — main/login/QR/games/detail) are Compose `setContent {}`. **2.2 converted the last out-of-game holdout: `ExternalControllerBindingsActivity` → Compose.**
  - **In-game stays classic Java by design** = `XServerDisplayActivity` inflates `xserver_display_activity.xml` to host the native `SurfaceView`/`GLSurfaceView` (X11 + Vulkan/GL renderer + Wine draw there — can't live in a Compose tree). 2.2 made the in-game **drawer + dialogs Compose islands** via `ComposeView` (`XServerDrawer.kt`, `XServerDialogHost.kt`).
  - **Proportion honesty:** Java is larger by LOC (~**297 .java / ~53k LOC**) but it's the **emulation engine**, not screens — `xserver/` 7.4k, `renderer/` 5.3k, `core/` 5.2k, `inputcontrols/` 3.6k, store backends, box64/fexcore/winhandler/container/xenvironment/xconnector/alsa/midi/sysvshm. Remaining **legacy XML/Java UI** = perf HUD (`frame_rating`/`hud_*`), `BigPictureActivity`, `ControlsEditorActivity` (control-element editor), file/folder pickers (`ShortcutPicker`/`FolderPicker`/`CustomFilePicker`), native over-surface dialogs (`ContentDialog`/`DownloadProgressDialog`/`TaskManagerDialog.java`). Some XML now **orphaned** (e.g. `shortcut_settings_dialog.xml` — no longer referenced). **75 layout XML / ~5.4k LOC, shrinking.**
- Release: <https://github.com/The412Banner/Bannerlator/releases/tag/2.2>

## 2026-06-30 — UI rebuild MERGED to main + 9 new theme presets (artifacts build)

**The umbrella hold is collapsed.** User decided the rebuild is feature-complete enough to merge and apply small fixes forward, so `feat/ui-rebuild` was merged into `main` and a fresh batch of opt-in themes added.

- **Merge:** `feat/ui-rebuild` → `main` = merge commit `35c8a28`. Only `PROGRESS_LOG.md` conflicted (docs); resolved as a union. Code tree verified identical to the umbrella tip (no code conflicts). Brings in: drawers rebuild (P1), theme centralization, drawer dialogs (P2), app-screen colour sweep (P3), on-screen controls + per-profile custom control colour (P4a), legacy-XML accent (P4b), TM-cards, External Controller Bindings → Compose, and File Manager Favorites.
- **9 new theme presets** = commit `5d75439`: Midnight Cobalt, Phosphor, Carbon & Ember, Amethyst, Crimson, Synthwave, Royal Gold, Frost, Monochrome. All opt-in; **AMOLED stays the default**. Inserted *before* "Custom" in `themePresets` so existing saved preset indices 0..6 are unaffected; `AppThemeState.init` adds a one-time `preset_schema_v2` migration that remaps anyone on the old Custom slot (index 7) to the new `CUSTOM_PRESET_INDEX`. `onPrimary` forced dark on light/bright accents (phosphor/gold/frost/mono) for legible on-accent text. AppearanceScreen renders them automatically (`themePresets.chunked(4)`).
- **Build:** pushed to `origin/main` after a brief github outage; artifacts-only build (workflow_dispatch `main.yml`) run `28470653013` in progress. **No release, no version bump** (hard rule).
- ▶️ **GATE before any release:** consolidated on-device test of the whole merged stack — favorites, bindings-Compose, TM-cards, P4b, custom-control-colour sub-items (per-game persist/relaunch, out-of-game editor, back-compat), and the 9 new presets (each recolours app + drawer; AMOLED default unchanged; on-accent text legible). Nothing post-P4a is device-proven yet.

## 2026-06-30 — File Manager FAVORITES — CODE DONE + CI ✅GREEN (preview signed off)

**Status:** implemented on `feat/ui-rebuild` — commits `bd57830` (feature) + `34247eb` (Back closes Favorites first) + `c06a397` (toasts on add/remove). CI `28467705193` ✅GREEN (pre-toast); toast commit CI `28469094380` ✅GREEN (tip `c06a397`). NOT merged (umbrella hold). Decisions: both pin entry points + global/absolute-path scope. ▶️ At device-test gate.

- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/star/util/FavoritesStore.kt` (new) — SharedPreferences, ordered JSON array of absolute paths (`list/isFavorite/add/remove/toggle`). Stores only the path; the card label is derived live.
- `FileManagerScreen.kt` — `describeLocation()`/`FavLocation`/`FavStorage`/`badgeColors`; ⭐ toggle in the path bar (this screen has no top bar — New-Folder is a bottom FAB); content-swap (favorites list REPLACES the file list, path shows "★ Favorites", drive chip dims); `FavoritesList`+`FavoriteCard` (FileItemRow card style + drive badge + container/source line + mono path line + unpin star); row ⋮ "Add to/Remove from Favorites"; "Pin current folder" header action; system Back closes favorites before navigating up. `favTick` drives recompute on pin/unpin.
- ▶️ NEXT: CI green → device test (dedicated list swap; full origin labels incl. container name; jump; both pin paths; persist across relaunch; dead-path drop; Back closes favorites; no FM regressions).

### (prior) DESIGN + HTML PREVIEW

A Discord user asked for favorite/bookmarked directories in the File Manager. After clarification the design is:
- A **⭐ star button** in the top bar that **toggles** a favorites strip directly under the path/drive bar (slides in/out; zero vertical cost when collapsed).
- Favorites render as File-Manager-style cards (`surfaceContainer` + outline), each with a **colour-coded LOCATION badge** showing where it lives — Internal (blue) / SD card (green) / `C:` + container name (amber) / `Z:` imagefs (purple). One-tap jump.
- **Pin** via each folder row's ⋮ menu ("Add to Favorites") + a "Pin current folder" header action; **unpin** via the card's filled ★. Empty-state prompt.
- Theme-follows-accent; badges keep semantic identity colours.

**Why it's cheap:** the "go there" mechanism already exists — `FileManagerScreen.kt:168 openDrive(File)` is a generic jump-to-any-dir. Favorites = persisted `(path)` entries fed into it. Generalize the existing `currentDriveLabel` (`:498-503`) into a `describeLocation(path)` helper for the badges (add container name for `C:` paths via `containers` at `:123` + `Container.getName()`). Pin item goes in the row ⋮ (`:779-807`). Persistence = SharedPreferences/DataStore string-set, global/absolute paths v1, dead paths filtered by the existing `exists()` pattern (`:358`). Pure app-layer (Compose + prefs).

**Open decisions (blocking Kotlin):** (1) container-drive badge text — letter / container name / both; (2) one vs both pin entry points; (3) scope global/absolute (recommended) vs per-container.

**Preview:** `bannerlator_fm_favorites_preview.html` (scratchpad + `~/Downloads`; not pushed to device — no adb this session).

## 2026-06-30 — In-game Task Manager rows as cards (match File Manager) + 2 P4 fixes bundled (CODE DONE + CI building)

**TL;DR:** Task Manager processes in the in-game drawer now render as cards like the app File Manager
rows (user request), and the two prior P4 device-test fixes ride along. Latest commit `3e94450` on
`feat/ui-rebuild`, CI `28462330620` building, at device gate. Not merged (umbrella hold).
- `XServerDrawer.kt`: `TmProcessRow` wrapped in a Card matching `FileManagerScreen.FileItemRow`
  (RoundedCornerShape 10dp, `surfaceContainer`, `outline` border, 3dp vertical margin); removed the
  single-surface column + inter-row dividers (cards self-space).
- Bundled (CI-green at `589566c`, not yet device-tested): controls-editor uses app theme accent in
  editMode; binding-spinner text luminance floor (never invisible).

---

## 2026-06-30 — P4 device-test fixes: controls-editor readability + binding text never invisible (CODE DONE + CI building)

**TL;DR:** Two bugs surfaced in device testing of P4b/custom-color, both fixed. Commit `589566c` on
`feat/ui-rebuild`, CI `28461375330` building, at device gate. Not merged (umbrella hold).
- **Controls editor** rendered the on-screen buttons/labels in the per-profile in-game *custom* accent
  (a dark custom colour → unreadable, and it ignored the app theme). Fix: `resolveBaseAccentArgb()` uses
  the app theme accent in `editMode` (the editor); in-game still honours the per-profile custom colour.
- **Binding-spinner text** (themed in P4b) could go invisible on the screen's black background under a
  dark accent — the original black-on-black bug. Fix: `AccentArrayAdapter` applies a luminance floor
  (0.18) → accent when legible, white when too dark; default blue + presets keep their colour.

---

## 2026-06-30 — UI rebuild Phase 4b: legacy XML surfaces follow runtime accent (CODE DONE + reviewed + CI building)

**TL;DR:** The remaining LIVE legacy `@color/colorPrimary` surfaces now follow the runtime theme accent
(fed at inflation via `AppThemeState.getCurrentAccentArgb()`); `colors.xml` keeps #0055FF as the static
fallback so the AMOLED default is unchanged. Dead/Compose-replaced layouts skipped. Commit `7ed3f10` on
`feat/ui-rebuild`, CI `28459471318` building, **at device gate**. Not merged (umbrella hold).

### What changed
- New `widget/AccentArrayAdapter` — re-applies the runtime accent to the controller-binding spinner item
  + dropdown TextViews (both binding-spinner activities point at it; they didn't share an adapter before).
- `ExternalControllerBindingsActivity`: toolbar header background → accent; type + binding spinners →
  AccentArrayAdapter (dropdown view resource preserved).
- `ControlsEditorActivity`: binding spinners → AccentArrayAdapter.
- `ContentDialog`: title icon tint + title text + bottom-bar label → accent; body `TVMessage` untouched.
- `InputControlsFragment` (+ layout id): the "External Controllers" section header → accent at runtime.
- Trash icon left as-is (styled `colorPrimaryDark` on a raster PNG, not `colorPrimary`).

### Device-test gate (pending)
Under a non-default preset: controller-bindings screen header bar + binding-spinner text recolor; native
ContentDialog prompts show accent title/icon/label (body stays readable); Input Controls "External
Controllers" header recolors. At AMOLED default everything stays #0055FF (unchanged).

## 2026-06-30 — Per-profile custom accent color for on-screen controls — ✅ CORE DEVICE-PROVEN

Commit `f6ea902` on `feat/ui-rebuild`, CI `28455766095` green. Device-proven (core) via user screenshot:
the in-game Controls tab shows the shared HSV picker ("Controls Accent", hex `#8F6A00`) and the on-screen
controls (A–F row + MRB/BKSP/SPACE/ENTER) render in that amber custom color while the app/drawer stay
green-themed — i.e. the controls are decoupled from the app theme, the override + live redraw work, and
the shared ColorPicker reuse works in-game. Not yet visually confirmed (wired, expected fine): per-game
persistence across relaunch, the out-of-game editor checkbox+swatch path, and old-profile back-compat.
Not merged (umbrella hold). Remaining rebuild work: P4b legacy XML, then single merge.

## 2026-06-30 — Per-profile custom accent color for on-screen controls (CODE DONE + reviewed + CI building)

**TL;DR:** Users can override the theme accent on the in-game touch controls with a **custom color saved
per control profile (= per game)**, so the same setup returns next launch. Follow-app-theme stays the
default. Commit `f6ea902` on `feat/ui-rebuild`, CI run `28455766095` building, **at the device gate**.
Not merged (umbrella hold).

### What changed (11 files)
- `ControlsProfile` gains `customAccentEnabled` + `customAccentColor`, serialized in `save()` (header,
  before the elements array). `InputControlsManager.loadProfile` parses them and replaces the brittle
  `fieldsRead==3` break with an explicit break at `elements`/`controllers` — robust to the optional
  fields and old profiles (which just default to follow-theme).
- `InputControlsView.resolveBaseAccentArgb()` = the active profile's custom color when it opted in,
  else the theme accent; the Phase-4a accent getters all derive from it (ControlElement inherits).
- Shared HSV picker extracted to `ui/components/ColorPicker.kt` (reused by Appearance, the in-game
  Controls tab, and a `ComposeView`-hosted `AlertDialog` for the legacy editor, with the three
  ViewTree owners wired so Compose runs outside the activity content view).
- In-game: `XServerDrawerState` + Controls-tab "Follow app theme" toggle + picker; `XServerDisplayActivity`
  seeds from the active profile and persists + redraws live on change / profile switch.
- Out-of-game: `InputControlsFragment` + layout get a Follow-theme checkbox + color swatch → shared picker.

### Device-test gate (pending)
Default = follow theme (unchanged); toggle off → pick color → controls recolor live; set on game A,
relaunch A → persists; game B keeps its own; toggle back on → returns to theme; editor picker persists;
old profiles still load.

## 2026-06-30 — UI rebuild Phase 4a: on-screen touch controls follow theme accent — ✅ DEVICE-PROVEN

Commit `df5ce64` on `feat/ui-rebuild`, CI `28453428988` green. Device-proven via user screenshot on a
green/Forest preset: the in-game GAMEHUB-style on-screen controls (A–F shoulder row + MRB/BKSP/SPACE/
ENTER keys) render in the theme accent (green) and the in-game Controls tab is themed to match —
confirming both the classic-path literal routing and the `resolveAccentColor()` stub-wiring (GAMEHUB
glass style) work on hardware. Not merged (umbrella hold). Next: per-profile custom control color
(in progress, same branch), then P4b legacy XML.

---

## 2026-06-30 — UI rebuild Phase 4a: on-screen touch controls follow theme accent (CODE DONE + CI building)

**TL;DR:** Phase 4 = the native/legacy surfaces that Compose theming doesn't reach, wired to the
accent via `AppThemeState.getCurrentAccentArgb()`. **P4a = the in-game on-screen touch controls** —
code-complete on `feat/ui-rebuild` (commit `df5ce64`), CI run `28453428988` building, **at the device
gate**. Not merged (umbrella hold). Next after device-proof = P4b (legacy XML).

### What changed (2 files)
- `widget/InputControlsView.java`: `getSecondaryColor()` now returns the live theme accent (keeping
  the overlay alpha) instead of hardcoded `#0277BD`. Added `getAccentColor()` (full-opacity accent) +
  `getAccentBrightColor()` (accent lerped 55% toward white, for the pressed highlight) + a small
  `lerpToWhite` helper. `getPrimaryColor()` (white idle controls) unchanged.
- `inputcontrols/ControlElement.java`: every `0xff0277bd` → `getAccentColor()` and every `0xff64ddff`
  → `getAccentBrightColor()` across the classic-style strokes, dpad/stick, and button-icon tints;
  collapsed the now-identical GAMEHUB/default icon-tint branch. **Key fix:** `resolveAccentColor()` was
  a `-1` stub (forcing the always-blue fallback) — wired it to `getAccentColor()`, so the GAMEHUB
  "glass" control style (fill/stroke/pressed/text/thumb) now follows the theme too.

### Deliberately out of scope
- **Perf HUD** (`PerfHudView` / `FrameRating*` / `HudMetrics`) — all colors are semantic (FPS
  thresholds + per-metric identity), left untouched (same reasoning as the P3 per-tech dots).
- Idle control tint (white), semantic reds/blacks, and `CPUListView`/`EnvVarsView` (already on the bridge).
- **P4b — legacy XML `@color/colorPrimary` surfaces** (binding spinners, content_dialog,
  input_controls_fragment, main_menu_header, …) — deferred to a separate follow-up; judgment-heavy and
  touches the intentional binding-spinner-blue fix.

### Device-test gate (pending)
Install (manual), launch a container, open the on-screen controls, apply Sunset → control accent
(selected/active/pressed strokes, dpad/stick, icon tints) should be orange not blue, in both the
classic and GAMEHUB visual styles; idle controls stay white; controls still register touch/press.

## 2026-06-30 — UI rebuild: Phase 3 DEVICE-PROVEN + Games-cards-match-Containers follow-up (device-proven)

**TL;DR:** Phase 3 (app-screen colour sweep) is now **device-proven** (all 4 checks pass), and a
small follow-up makes the **Games list cards look like the Containers cards** — also device-proven.
Still on the umbrella branch `feat/ui-rebuild` (no merge until the whole rebuild is done).
Next = Phase 4 (native/legacy surfaces via `getCurrentAccentArgb`).

### Phase 3 — app-screen colour sweep — ✅ DEVICE-PROVEN
Commits `8a97185` (sweep ~190 literals → theme tokens) + `b20a58d` (3b: elevated `surfaceContainer`
tokens to restore card depth). Device test on the ludashi build, all 4 pass: (a) AMOLED default card
depth restored, (b) Sunset recolors the whole app incl. headline FAB + renderer/DXVK chips, (c) wiring
intact, (d) semantic/per-tech colors kept.

### Follow-up — Games list cards match Containers cards — ✅ DEVICE-PROVEN
Commit `c6116f5`, CI `28451457959` green. User gripe: the Games list item was a flat edge-to-edge row
while the Containers entry is a floating card. Fix in `ShortcutsScreen.kt` — wrapped `ShortcutItemLayoutL`
in the same `Card` as `ContainersScreen` (rounded 12dp `surfaceVariant` panel, `outline` border, 16dp/6dp
outer margins, 12dp inner padding; `onRun` moved from `Row.clickable` → `Card` onClick) and removed the
inter-item `Divider`. Grid view unchanged (already a bordered tile). User installed manually + confirmed
"looks much better" from a screenshot = device-proven. Not merged (umbrella hold).

---

## 2026-06-30 — Theme + Drawer rebuild: Phase 3 CODE DONE + CI GREEN (at device gate); Phase 2 DEVICE-PROVEN

**TL;DR:** Catch-up checkpoint for Phases 2 & 3 of the UI rebuild. All work lives on the
umbrella branch **`feat/ui-rebuild`** (no merge to main until the whole rebuild is done).
**Phase 2 (drawer dialogs) is device-proven**; **Phase 3 (app-screen colour sweep) is code-complete
and CI-green, now at the device-test gate.**

### Phase 2 — drawer dialogs — ✅ DEVICE-PROVEN (2026-06-30, 2nd attempt)
Commit `33eeb6a` on `feat/ui-rebuild`, CI `28440636066` green. Driven on the ludashi build
(`com.ludashi.benchmark` code 34) via the root bridge, Sunset preset, Vulkan container. All four
checklist items passed, no regressions:
- **Recolor under preset** — in-game drawer, Task Manager tab, CPU/Memory sections, and the New
  Task dialog all themed orange under Sunset; selected rail tab = orange pill.
- **Task Manager MoreVert** — "Bring to Front" (FlipToFront icon, neutral) + "End Process"
  (X/Close icon, red error-tint, destructive); New Task… (accent) + Clear footer themed.
- **🎉 Group B win — New Task dialog VISIBLE on Vulkan AND works** — the old native
  `ContentDialog.prompt` was invisible on Vulkan/ASR; converted to a Compose `AlertDialog`
  (title, text field defaulting `taskmgr.exe`, Cancel/OK). Tapping OK → `winHandler.exec`
  launched the real Windows Task Manager (Running on guest). End-to-end proven.
- **Wiring intact** — dropdown opens, New Task exec spawns a process, Exit → clean Shutdown
  teardown → clean return to Games. No crash/hang.
- Capture note: a persistent detached `logcat` must write to `/data/local/tmp` (not `/sdcard`,
  which is namespace-isolated under magisk su) to survive the bridge connection dropping.

### Phase 3 — app-screen colour sweep — ✅ CODE DONE + CI GREEN, ▶️ AT DEVICE GATE
Two commits on `feat/ui-rebuild`, both CI-green (workflow_dispatch `main.yml`):
- **`8a97185` "phase 3" — the sweep** (CI `28447905004` ✅): ~190 hardcoded `Color(0x…)` sites
  across 13 in-scope Compose screens rerouted onto `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.*` /
  `LocalAccentDim.current`. Stores (`store/*`) and theme-definition files
  (Color/ThemePreset/AppThemeState/Theme) left untouched; colour-only.
  - **Headline fix:** `ShortcutsScreen` FAB(+), grid-tile gradient, scrape icon → `primary`;
    `SpecCardComponents` renderer + DXVK chips → `primary` (so they follow the accent).
  - **Kept semantic colours:** green success `4CAF50`, `installedBlue 4FC3F7`, amber `FFC107`,
    error reds, untrusted salmon, per-tech identity dots, contrast white/black.
- **`b20a58d` "phase 3b" — elevated surfaces (user-approved fix)** (CI `28449013883` ✅): phase-3
  had no token matching the bespoke navy card surfaces / dialog greys → they flattened to
  near-black at default. Fixed by adding Material3's built-in `surfaceContainer` family slots to
  `ThemePreset` (data-class fields + set in `toColorScheme`/`toLightColorScheme`; derived defaults
  `lerp(surface, onSurface, 0.05/0.09/0.14)` so every preset gets a recolouring elevation ramp).
  - **AMOLED override values:** `surfaceContainer=0xFF1A1A2E`, `surfaceContainerHigh=0xFF2A2A38`,
    `surfaceContainerHighest=0xFF38383F` (restores blue-on-black card depth).
  - Repointed Settings / InputControls / FileManager navy cards & buttons by original depth order,
    and themed the leftover dialog greys (`2A2A2A`→High, `333333` tracks→Highest, body text
    `CCCCCC/E0E0E0`→onSurface, `AAAAAA/B0BEC5`→onSurfaceVariant). `Theme.kt` DefaultColorScheme
    confirmed dead/unused.

### Two sanctioned default-look changes to eyeball on device
(User OK'd default changes for this rebuild.) (1) renderer/DXVK chips are now accent-blue at the
AMOLED default instead of teal/green — the requested "chips follow the theme"; (2) Settings/Input/
FileManager card depth — flattened by 3a, restored by 3b's elevated tokens → confirm it reads
~like the original at default and recolours under a preset.

### ▶️ Next
Device-test Phase 3 on the ludashi build (user installs the `ludashi-debug` artifact from CI run
`28449013883`): (a) AMOLED default — Settings/dialogs have raised card depth, nothing broken;
(b) apply Sunset → Games FAB + renderer/DXVK chips + Settings + InputControls + FileManager +
dialogs all recolour; (c) wiring intact; (d) green success buttons stayed green. Then Phase 4
(native/legacy via `getCurrentAccentArgb`) and Phase 5 (optional presets). Merge `feat/ui-rebuild`
→ main only when ALL phases are device-proven.

---

## 2026-06-30 — Theme + Drawer rebuild: Phase 1 DEVICE-PROVEN (all checklist items pass)

**TL;DR:** Phase 1 (themed icons + button restyle of BOTH drawers) is now **device-proven**.
On-device verification on the ludashi build (`com.ludashi.benchmark` code 34, branch
`feat/drawer-rebuild-p1` @ `f30db20`, CI `28434248077` green @ `f30db209`) passed all four
checklist items with **no wiring regressions**. At the merge decision; not yet merged.

### Device test results (release-device-engineer, root bridge)
- **(a) App drawer — PASS** — LIBRARY/SYSTEM/STORES section headers (STORES "· unchanged"
  subtitle), distinct gamepad Games icon, palette Appearance icon (distinct from Settings),
  "NEW" badge, accent glow bar on selected item.
- **(b) Appearance reachable + live recolor — PASS** — Appearance opens from the drawer;
  Sunset preset recolored the whole app AND the drawer live; restored to AMOLED default.
  (Also clears the previously-untested base build `96ed50e`: Appearance nav entry +
  PrimaryDim→accentDim fix both confirmed — scaling chips/borders recolored orange.)
- **(c) In-game drawer — PASS** — AIO Graphics Test container (OpenGL): Graphics rail shows a
  monitor/display icon as a filled accent pill; selected "Linear" scaling chip accent-filled
  with black text; whole in-game drawer themed orange under Sunset.
- **(d) Wiring intact — PASS, no regressions** — launch ×2, tab-switch, Task Manager (7 procs),
  End Process → real kill → clean Shutdown teardown to app, Bring-to-Front dispatched clean
  (visual no-op on single-window AIO = documented native-fullscreen visibility limit), Pause
  fired, Exit closed cleanly to Games.

### Decisions
- **"NEW" badge on Appearance: KEEP for this release** (clean accent pill, not noisy; treat
  as temporary — fine to drop later once Appearance is discovered).
- Out-of-P1-scope (NOT a regression): Games-screen FAB + renderer/DXVK chips stayed blue under
  Sunset — screen-level hardcoded literals = the deferred P3 336-literal sweep.

### Next
- **Merge decision** for `feat/drawer-rebuild-p1` (stacked off the unmerged base
  `feat/theme-centralize-drawer` @ `96ed50e` — merging P1 carries the base; both proven
  together). → then **Phase 2** (drawer dialogs, incl. native ContentDialog → Compose).

## 2026-06-30 — Theme + Drawer rebuild: plans reconciled, Phase 1 (drawer rebuild) building

**TL;DR:** Merged the recolor-only theme-centralization plan with the new drawer-rebuild
request into one plan (`docs/THEME_AND_DRAWER_REBUILD_PLAN.md`). User greenlit **Phase 1**
(themed icons + button restyle of BOTH drawers). Phase 1 is compiling on branch
`feat/drawer-rebuild-p1`. No device test yet — this is a checkpoint before that.

### Decisions
- **Default look may now CHANGE** for the drawers — user dropped the old byte-identical-to-2.1.1
  rule. The rebuilt drawer look ships as the new default. (Other phases' app-screen recolor stays
  visually conservative.)
- **Restyle depth only** — icons + button styling + accent-driven states. NO wiring / structure /
  tab-order / handler changes. End-Process / Bring-to-Front / Exit / Pause / launch / controller
  paths untouched. Stores excluded.
- **Typography ramp + light mode stay CUT** (keep close to original).

### Combined plan = 5 phases
- P0 foundation: Branch 1 in-game color centralization (device-proven) + follow-up `96ed50e`
  (PrimaryDim→LocalAccentDim + Appearance nav entry), CI `28431784626` GREEN — not device-tested
  in isolation; its only independent piece (Appearance nav entry) gets verified inside the P1 test.
- **P1 (BUILDING)** = drawer rebuild: `AppDrawer.kt` (centralize local consts → colorScheme/
  LocalAccentDim, add LIBRARY/SYSTEM/STORES section headers, fix icon gaps Games→distinct gamepad,
  Appearance→`icon_palette`) + `XServerDrawer.kt` (Graphics rail → display icon, scaling/frame-gen/
  toggle/HUD-chip buttons restyled to accent-fill states on the already-centralized colors) + new
  drawables. Branch `feat/drawer-rebuild-p1` stacked off `feat/theme-centralize-drawer` (build =
  base + P1). Worktree `/home/claude-user/wt-drawer-p1`.
- P2 drawer dialogs (incl. native ContentDialogs needing Compose conversion) · P3 app-screen color
  sweep (~336 literals, old Branch 2) · P4 native/legacy via `getCurrentAccentArgb()` · P5 optional
  Midnight Cobalt + Phosphor presets.

### Approved preview
`bannerlator_drawer_rebuild_preview.html` (scratchpad + ~/Downloads + device /sdcard/Download) —
both drawers, live preset + HSV switcher, Before/Rebuilt toggle. Signed off → became P1.

### Next
Agent finishes P1 → push → CI "Any branch compilation." green → **device test** (gate = looks right
+ wiring intact, NOT byte-identical). SAVE memory + this log + commit BEFORE that device test
(same-device OOM rule).

**UPDATE (2026-06-30, later):** P1 code DONE + **CI `28434248077` GREEN**. Branch
`feat/drawer-rebuild-p1` @ `f30db20`. 4 files: AppDrawer.kt + XServerDrawer.kt + new `icon_games.xml`
+ `icon_display.xml`. Wiring confirmed untouched (no handler/structure/order changes). Open question
for user: keep the additive "NEW" badge on Appearance? **Now AT the device-test gate** — checkpoint
re-flushed; user drives the install + test. Phase-completion checkpoint will follow once device-proven.

**⏸️ PAUSED (2026-06-30) — user lost Wi-Fi mid-session, resuming at work.** Nothing in flight; all
pushed. RESUME = device-test the `feat/drawer-rebuild-p1` build (CI `28434248077` green, ludashi
flavor) per the checklist above + decide the Appearance "NEW" badge; on pass → phase-completion
checkpoint → decide merge → Phase 2 (drawer dialogs). Full resume pointer in memory

## 2026-06-30 — Theme centralization: reroute hardcoded colors onto the live theme (branch 1 started)

**TL;DR:** Starting a refactor so the existing theme engine actually paints everywhere — a
preset/accent now recolors the **whole app AND the in-game drawer**, which it doesn't today.
**Hard constraint from the user: the DEFAULT look must stay byte-identical to 2.1.1 (AMOLED,
#0055FF on pure black).** New presets are opt-in; no surprise on update. Stores are out of scope —
only the out-of-game Compose UI and the in-game side drawer + its submenus.

### Why (recon on main 2.1.1)
- `ui/theme/Color.kt`: `Primary`/`GlowPurple`/`AccentBlue` are **static consts** — a custom accent
  never reaches code that uses them directly. Core bug.
- `ui/XServerDrawer.kt` (the in-game drawer, 6 tabs: Graphics/HUD/ReShade/Controls/Advanced/Task Mgr):
  wrapped in `WinlatorTheme` so it inherits fonts but reads `colorScheme` for **zero** colors — paints
  from 6 local hardcoded constants (PureBlack/DarkSurface/…) + the static Primary/GlowPurple. ~37 literal
  sites. So a red accent leaves the drawer blue-on-black.
- Out-of-game: **336+ hardcoded literals** bypass the theme (worst: SettingsScreen 77, ContentsScreen 26,
  InputControlsScreen 21).

### Scope (user-trimmed: "close to original, no extreme complications")
- **CUT** typography ramp (leave force-600) and light-mode revival (leave dead) — colors only.
- Default stays **AMOLED**; existing users keep their saved preset (`AppThemeState` already persists).

### Plan
- **Branch 1 (this one) = steps 0-2:** (0) kill the static Primary/GlowPurple/AccentBlue aliases →
  resolve from the live scheme; (1) make the **AMOLED** preset carry today's EXACT shades (incl. the
  drawer's #000/#0D0D0D/#1A1A1A) so centralization is a visual no-op; (2) move `XServerDrawer.kt` fully
  onto `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.*`. Delivers "in-game drawer follows theme."
- Branch 2 = step 3: sweep the 336+ out-of-game literals, screen by screen (Settings first).
- Branch 3 = step 4: add Midnight Cobalt + Phosphor as **optional** presets.
- **Verify gate (every branch):** on-device before/after screenshot diff proving the default look is
  unchanged. The only failure mode is shade drift.

### Status (updated 2026-06-30)
- Branch `feat/theme-centralize-drawer`. Step-2 edit DONE in `ui/XServerDrawer.kt` (color-only).
- **Diff reviewed = color-only, verified safe:** no function signatures, no `onClick`/`winHandler`/lambda/
  control-flow lines changed. Only color args swapped + 20 `val accent = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary`
  and 1 `val surface = ...colorScheme.surface` locals added (pure theme reads). The 3 static imports
  (`Primary`/`GlowPurple`/`PrimaryDim`) removed; `PrimaryDim` kept as a drawer-LOCAL `Color(0xFF002277)`.
- **Drift-safety honored:** every accent site resolves to `colorScheme.primary` (= #0055FF under default
  AMOLED → byte-identical); pure-black panel/rail bg → `colorScheme.surface` (= #000000 under AMOLED). All
  neutral greys (`DarkSurface`/`DimWhite`/`MutedWhite`/toggle-off/#1A1A1A dividers/#4CAF50 green) left local.
- **Known limitation (deliberate):** `PrimaryDim` sites (switch-ON track, AccentButton container,
  selected-tab gradient bottom, HudChip selected bg) do NOT recolor for a CUSTOM accent — they stay
  dark-blue. #002277 maps to no exact scheme slot, so routing it would drift the default. Revisit later if
  we want those to follow the accent (accept a tiny default shift).
- **Functional safety = the user's concern:** theme edit cannot alter wiring. App↔drawer, Wine/containers,
  controller input (legacy `InputControlsView.java`, NOT touched), and all drawer buttons keep their exact
  handlers. Verify gate = on-device functional pass (End Process / Bring to Front / Pause / Exit / Apply &
  Close / ReShade toggle / controller drives game) + before/after color diff. **User drives the device tests.**
- Committed + pushed branch `feat/theme-centralize-drawer`. CI APK build (main.yml,
  **run 28419854007**) **✅ GREEN** 2026-06-30 — all 3 flavors built clean (standard/pubg/ludashi-debug
  ~560 MB each). Color-only diff compiled with NO fixes needed. **APK READY for the morning device test**
  (download the `standard-debug` artifact from run 28419854007).
- **PLAN: user device-tests in the MORNING** (user went to bed 2026-06-30). Build is green; no overnight
  fix was needed. Green APK + test checklist are ready.
- ON-DEVICE CHECKLIST (user drives, I watch logcat): (1) launch game in a real container → open drawer;
  (2) wiring — Task Mgr End Process / Bring to Front / Pause-Resume / Exit-to-app / Controls Apply&Close /
  ReShade toggle / controller drives game; (3) app side — launch + edit a container/shortcut; (4) color —
  default AMOLED drawer unchanged, then custom accent → drawer highlights recolor. EXPECTED non-bug:
  switch-ON tracks + a couple selected-chip bgs stay dark-blue under custom accent (the PrimaryDim call).
- Preview mock: `bannerlator_theme_preview_v2.html` (~/Downloads + /sdcard/Download).

## 2026-06-29 — bionic-fg: upstream MERGED our compat PR #6; fork synced; branch-landscape mapped for later

**TL;DR:** Our Android wrapper-ICD compatibility fix was **merged into upstream bionic-fg**
(`xXJSONDeruloXx/bionic-fg` PR #6, squash commit `68497bf`). Synced our fork `main` to it
(clean fast-forward, identical). Audited what the shipped build contains vs every open branch/PR.
No code changes this entry — this is a checkpoint so the shader/model work can be picked up later.

### What merged (PR #6 — "Single-device mode + layer-dispatch routing for Android wrapper ICDs")
- Authored by The412Banner, +310/-22 / 7 files. Fixes the hang-at-first-interpolated-present on the
  Wine+DXVK -> Turnip `wrapper_icd` stack: (1) manifest `disable_environment`, (2) single-device mode
  (run gen on the app's OWN VkDevice -> kills the 2-device cross-instance deadlock), (3) dispatch
  routing via `memPropsFn` + bounded 250ms fence waits + optional `fps_limit`. Device-proven Adreno 750
  2x/3x/4x. Squash-merge `68497bf` rolled in the 4 layer-robustness refinements too.

### Build provenance (verified 2026-06-29)
- Bannerlator submodule still pinned to upstream base `4f71770`; CI (`build-bionic-fg.yml`) applies
  `patches/bionic-fg-bannerlator-fixes.patch` at build time. Verified: that patch applied to the base ==
  merged `68497bf` **byte-for-byte** (0-line diff). So our source == merged main.
- Cleanup available (NOT done): bump the submodule to `68497bf` and DELETE the now-redundant patch.
  Must be one combined change — bumping the pin without removing the patch breaks `git apply` (already
  applied) and fails the bionic-fg CI build.

### Branch / PR landscape vs the SHIPPED build (`68497bf`)
- `feat/toml-hot-reload` (upstream) — MERGED, already in our build.
- **`feat/shader-pool-gamescope-v2`** (our fork, tip `b0c2e5c`) — HIGHEST ROI. New = ~+22.7k lines
  `shaders_embedded.hpp` (FIXES the malformed `shader_02` we currently ship + pools GameScopeVK/V2
  shaders) + `model=2` "V2 engine". This is the open shader-pool thread.
- **`feat/fsr3-optical-flow-model`** (our fork, tip `603d26e`) — HIGHEST CEILING, heaviest. Superset of
  shader-pool + `model=3` AMD FidelityFX Optical Flow (4 new compute shaders, ~+24.8k embedded,
  `NOTICE_FIDELITYFX_OPTICALFLOW.md`, standalone `build-so.yml`). Needs on-device perf+visual validation.
- `fix/model1-remove-warpblend` (upstream, 1 commit) — cheap correctness fix (removes a model-1
  warp-blend stage that shouldn't exist). Not in our build.
- PR #5 `feat/future-refresh-pacing` (upstream, OPEN) — alt frame pacing, overlaps our `fps_limit`,
  unmerged + unproven on Turnip. Lowest confidence.

### Caveat for whoever resumes
All branches above pre-date the squash, so they sit on the un-squashed compat commits (same content,
different SHAs) and read "1 behind". To integrate cleanly: REBASE onto synced `main`/`68497bf`
(cherry-pick only the genuinely-new commits) so the compat changes don't reappear as conflicts.
**Recommended start = `feat/shader-pool-gamescope-v2`** (fixes a bug we currently ship + it's our own
half-done work), then FSR3 `model=3`. Save+commit before any same-device test.

## 2026-06-29 (cont.) — STEP 3 ReShade: P2 DEVICE-PROVEN + typed controls/tab/reset + on-demand download catalog LIVE

**TL;DR:** The in-game ReShade feature is now fully device-proven (P2 done). Added typed UI controls,
a dedicated ReShade drawer tab, and a Reset button. Switched the effect library from APK-bundled to
**on-demand download** — published a 100-effect catalog (`reshade.json` + `reshade-v1` release) on
`The412Banner/winlator-contents`; the app-side download UI is building.

### P2 device-proven (in-game ReShade)
- Live `.fx` compile, live on/off, and live per-uniform sliders all confirmed on hardware (Technicolor,
  ArcaneBloom over The Saboteur). The `formatUniformLine` `<effect>_<uniform>` key syntax is correct.

### `feat/reshade-typed-controls` (off `fix/reshade-live-toggle`) — CI `28411754406` GREEN
- `ReshadeManager.ParamType += COMBO, COLOR`; `reflectParams` parses `floatN`/`intN` + `ui_items`
  (`\0`-split), and now **skips `source=`-annotated uniforms** (engine semantics like timer/frametime —
  ArcaneBloom's `uTime`/`uFrameTime` were leaking in as dead sliders).
- Drawer renders by type: bool→toggle, combo/radio→dropdown, color→HSV picker (collapsed by default,
  tap swatch to expand), slider/drag→slider. Value transport stays float-based; color = `<u>_0.._N` keys.
- New **dedicated ReShade tab** (`TabType.RESHADE`, `icon_screen_effect`) — pulled the ReShade block out
  of the Graphics tab. **Reset** button re-seeds every param to its `.fx` default via `onReshadeApply`.
- Pre-launch editors (container + shortcut) render the same typed controls (color = R/G/B sliders there).
- Device-confirmed: toggle ("Use Limits"), dropdown ("Debug Options"), color picker, collapse, Reset.

### On-demand download catalog (replaces APK bundling)
- Decision: do NOT ship `.fx` in the APK. Host on `The412Banner/winlator-contents`; the pre-launch effect
  picker shows the full catalog GREYED, each row downloads-and-fills-in on tap.
- **Published + LIVE:** `reshade.json` on repo `main` (100 effects) + 100 per-effect `.tzst` as assets on
  release **`reshade-v1`**. License-safe set only (crosire/prod80/luluco250/fubax; AstrayFX excluded for
  license ambiguity, qUINT excluded). Built by `scratchpad/reshade_catalog.py` (include+texture closure;
  prod80 `PD80_NN_` prefixes stripped for clean ids; category-tagged).
- Schema: `{schemaVersion,category,release,mirrorBase,count,effects[{id,name,description,category,author,
  license,url,file_size,file_checksum(MD5),version}]}`. `id` = drop-in folder name; tzst extracts into
  `getExternalFilesDir/ReShade/<id>/`.
- App side building on `feat/reshade-download-catalog` (off `feat/reshade-typed-controls`).

### Credits (for the next stable's release notes)
- vkBasalt engine: **DadSchoorse** (original, our patched .so builds from this) + **Pipetto-crypto**
  (Winlator integration, commit `67b6dad`) + **StevenMXZ** (Winlator-Ludashi). Shader authors:
  crosire/ReShade, prod80, luluco250, Fubaxiusz.

### Still ahead
- Codegen sweep (verify which of the 100 actually compile on vkBasalt → prune/flag catalog).
- Tier-1 hardening: existing-container layer heal, GPU/Mali coverage, Vulkan-only boundary.
- Merge the ReShade stack to main + cut the stable (with credits). Depth effects = STEP 4.

## 2026-06-29 — ▶️ RESUME HERE: STEP 3 ReShade effects — BUILT end-to-end, one device test from done

**TL;DR:** In-game ReShade `.fx` effects via the bundled vkBasalt layer. App feature + a patched live-reload
vkBasalt layer are BOTH built and CI-green; integrated build is compiling. **Only the on-hardware device test
remains.** Design doc: `docs/RESHADE_STEP3_PLAN.md`.

### Branches (all pushed to origin)
- `feat/reshade-step3` — app-side feature (5 commits). CI `28401038692` ✅ GREEN.
- `feat/reshade-vkbasalt-build` — patched libvkbasalt.so source/patch/workflow. CI `28401364441` ✅ GREEN.
- **`feat/reshade-integrated`** — `step3` ⊕ `vkbasalt-build` + integration commit (patched .so repacked into
  `extra_libs.tzst` + uniform-key fix). **THIS is the branch to install/test.** Combined CI `28402115564`
  (workflow "CI Build (artifacts only)") — was IN PROGRESS at handoff; check it on resume.

### What was proven / built this session
1. **Spike DEVICE-PROVEN:** hardcoded sepia `.fx` compiled on-device (vkBasalt reshadefx→SPIR-V→Turnip) and
   applied to a live DXVK game (The Saboteur) → screen went sepia. ReShade `.fx` on Adreno = real. Blockers
   #1 (language) + #2 (Adreno compile) empirically dead. (Depth effects still STEP 4.)
2. **Two infra bugs found + fixed:** (a) `extra_libs.tzst` (carries libvkbasalt.so) only extracted on container
   `firstTimeBoot` → existing containers never got the layer (silent no-op). Fixed: extract whenever the .so is
   absent. (b) the SHIPPED libvkbasalt.so has its key-detection compiled out (`isKeyPressedX11`→return false) +
   no uniform-override path → its HOME toggle is dead for ALL inputs and it can't do live sliders. ⇒ any live
   control REQUIRES a rebuilt layer (the X11-Home-inject "free toggle" idea is DEAD — dropped).
3. **App-side Phase 1** (android-app-engineer): `reshade/ReshadeManager.java` (drop-in folder scan +
   `.fx` ui_* param regex reflection, scalar float/int/bool); `Container.java` persists `reshadeEffect`/
   `reshadeParams`; `XServerDisplayActivity.java` extraction-gate fix + `writeVkBasaltConfig()` (merged with CAS
   into one `effects = <effect>:cas` chain) + `applyReshadeLive()` seam; in-game drawer ReShade section
   (`XServerDialogState.kt`/`XServerDrawer.kt`); effect pickers in shortcut + container editors.
   Drop-in folder = `getExternalFilesDir(null)/ReShade/` (one subfolder per effect; copied into guest HOME
   `.config/vkBasalt/effects/<name>/` at launch for host-absolute paths). Gated to DXVK/VKD3D.
4. **Patched vkBasalt** (graphics-vulkan-engineer): `patches/vkbasalt-reshade-livereload.patch` vs upstream
   `DadSchoorse/vkBasalt@4f97f09` (submodule `app/src/main/cpp/vkbasalt`), built via new `build-vkbasalt.yml`
   (meson Android cross, NDK r27c, arm64-v8a/android-24, X11-free). **Part A** = live on/off (Config remembers
   opened path; present-hook mtime-watch re-reads conf → flips `presentEffect` from `enableOnLaunch`; lsfg-mirror,
   no swapchain recreate). **Part B** = live sliders (codegen uniforms-to-spec-constants=FALSE → ui_* uniforms in
   UBO; new `GenericUniform` + `ReshadeEffect::updateUniformsFromConfig()` overrides from conf key
   `"<effect>_<uniform>"` → next-frame memcpy, no recompile). CI-green + binary-symbol-verified.
5. **Integration:** patched .so (stripped 1.85MB) repacked into `extra_libs.tzst`; `formatUniformLine()` aligned
   to emit `<effectKey>_<uniform>` to match the patch's read key.

### ▶️ NEXT (on resume, when home / Wi-Fi back)
1. Check combined CI `28402115564` (branch `feat/reshade-integrated`); if green, grab the APK artifact.
2. **DEVICE TEST on The Saboteur (DXVK)** — the unproven gate (all green/binary-verified, Part A+B untested on
   hardware): install integrated APK → use a **FRESH container** (old `xuser-4` has `libvkbasalt.so.disabled`
   from the spike sepia-cleanup; extraction-heal/new container installs the patched .so) → pick a ReShade effect
   → verify (a) effect renders CORRECTLY [Part B UBO change didn't break render], (b) drawer ReShade on/off
   toggles LIVE [Part A], (c) sliders move the image LIVE [Part B + key syntax]. ⚠️ uniform-override key form is
   the most likely thing to need a tweak — centralized in `formatUniformLine()`.
3. If green on device → tidy (strip note, drop the throwaway `spike/vkbasalt-reshade`), then decide merge to main.
   Live SLIDERS depend entirely on the patched .so working; if Part B misbehaves on device, on/off (Part A) is the
   lower-risk fallback to ship first.

⚠️ Memory file `project_bannerlator_step3_shader_loader_reshade` has the full detail + every commit/run id.

## 2026-06-28 (s4) — ▶️ RESUME / CURRENT STATUS: VRR + manual picker built & verified; pacing tweak pending

**Where things stand on the graphics roadmap:**
- **STEP 1 (debanding + NIS): DONE — MERGED to main** (`feat/deband-nis` ff `71e2d27..4565b80`, branch deleted).
  Both device-proven on Vulkan via the new AIO torture cards (banding ramp + scaling combo). Not in a tagged
  release yet (per versioning rule — no stable cut without explicit say-so).
- **STEP 2 (VRR / refresh-rate matching): BUILT + DEVICE-VERIFIED**, branch `feat/vrr-refresh-rate` (off main,
  NOT merged). Took 3 fixes to get the panel to actually move: seamless→ALWAYS (`c29acc0`), capability gating
  (`83da657`), and the big one — window `preferredRefreshRate` was pinning the panel to max and out-voting our
  surface vote (`35dd636`). After that, all 4 states verified on-device (Vulkan, AYANEO 144Hz panel):
  cap+match→60, cap+nomatch→144, uncapped+match→144, incapable→greyed. Clean 60↔144 both directions.
- **Manual refresh-rate picker: BUILT** (`fa77da6`, CI `28333613335` GREEN) — unified 'Refresh rate' drawer
  control (Auto match-FPS + manual snap-to-supported-modes chips, auto-detected via getSupportedRefreshRates;
  Auto greys chips; whole group greys on incapable devices). Editor got a manual FilterChip row. Auto path
  byte-identical (reviewed). DEVICE-TEST OWED.

**Open issue — FPS oscillation (user-observed):** with limiter=60 + Auto-match ON, FPS swings 56↔64 every few
seconds. Two suspects: (1) **AYASpace system refresh control** — the test device is an AYANEO handheld whose
AYASpace overlay has its OWN 'Refresh Rate' control (Auto/144/120/90/60), was pinned to 144; its polling
service likely re-asserts 144 vs our VRR every few seconds (matches the timing). (2) **limiter/VSync beat** —
matching the panel to exactly the cap removes the 144Hz headroom that hid the limiter's pacing jitter (panel
likely 59.94 vs cap 60.0). 

**▶️ NEXT (test plan, before merge):** (1) DIAGNOSTIC — set AYASpace Refresh Rate→Auto, re-test: swing stops =
system contention (config fix, document it), persists = pacing beat. (2) Install build `28333613335`, verify
manual picker (Auto-off+pick 90/120 → dumpsys locks panel to it regardless of cap) + headroom check (manual
120 + cap 60 should be smooth) + auto-path 4/4 regression. (3) If pacing beat confirmed → add **cap-below-
refresh** fix (pace limiter to ~refresh−1 when Auto matching). (4) Then MERGE feat/vrr-refresh-rate (VRR +
manual picker + any pacing fix) to main → then STEP 3.

**Device-driving notes:** measure VRR while game is FOREGROUND (it releases the vote on background); 'go'
handshake + `sleep 12; dumpsys` works. Key greps: activeMode= , setFrameRate=/{10492, the per-layer
`Hz ... Always/OnlySeamless` vote line. Move-cursor-to-touchpoint is ON (tap absolute). Newest device
screenshots in /sdcard/Pictures/Screenshots/.

## 2026-06-28 (s4) — 🆕 Manual refresh-rate picker built (unified Auto + manual control)

On top of the verified VRR, added a unified "Refresh rate" drawer control: the match-refresh toggle is now
"Auto (match FPS)" + a chip row of the panel's supported rates (auto-detected via `getSupportedRefreshRates`).
Auto ON → chips greyed (VRR drives it); Auto OFF → pick a rate and the panel locks to it regardless of the FPS
cap; whole group greys on incapable devices. `applyVrr` extended with an additive manual branch (auto path
byte-identical, reviewed). New state manualRefreshRate/supportedRefreshRates/onManualRefreshChange + Container
`manualRefreshRate` extra + resolver + editor FilterChip row. Commit `fa77da6`, CI run `28333613335`.
Device-test owed: Auto-off + pick 90 → panel locks 90 regardless of cap; chips greyed when Auto on; auto path
4/4 regression. Then merge the whole `feat/vrr-refresh-rate` (VRR + manual picker) to main.

---

## 2026-06-28 (s4) — ✅✅ VRR device-test #3: WORKING (+ clear-path verified) — panel drops 144→60 to match the FPS cap

Build `28332650876` (seamless fix `c29acc0` + capability gating `83da657` + window-pin fix `35dd636`). On
Vulkan, FPS cap 60, Match-refresh ON, game foreground: **activeMode 144.00→60.00 Hz** — the panel physically
switched. Override `{10492, 60.00 Hz}`, both layer votes now `60 Hz SeamedAndSeamless` (game surface + window
pref agree). VRR is device-proven end-to-end. The `preferredRefreshRate` lever moves this panel, so both
auto-VRR and a future manual refresh-rate picker will work here.

**Before merge:** verify toggle-off/uncapped returns the panel to 144 (clear path); optional GL/ASR spot-check
(shared code, Vulkan proven). **Next feature (green-lit):** manual refresh-rate picker — one control with
'Auto (match FPS)' + manual snap-to-supported-modes (60/90/120/144 auto-detected via getSupportedModes); Auto
greys the slider; whole control greys on single-mode/pre-A11 devices. Same `preferredRefreshRate` lever.


**Clear-path verified (test #3b):** toggling "Match refresh rate to FPS" OFF returned the panel 144 Hz (activeMode 60→144, both votes restored to 144). So VRR does the full round trip — drops to the cap when on, restores max when off. Also verified the cap-dependency: limiter OFF + match ON (uncapped) → panel returns to 144 (VRR only acts while capping). All 4 states confirmed {ON+match→60, ON+nomatch→144, OFF+match→144, incapable→greyed}. **VRR comprehensively verified and ready to merge.**

## 2026-06-28 (s4) — 🐛➡️✅ VRR device-test #2: surface fix confirmed, fixed a 2nd blocker (window pins max refresh)

Re-tested with the seamless fix (`c29acc0`) + capability gating (`83da657`). Our game-surface vote is now correct —
`60.00 Hz Default SeamedAndSeamless` (the force-switch worked; was OnlySeamless). But the panel still held 144
because a 2nd layer voted 144: `XServerDisplayActivity.onCreate` pins `window.preferredRefreshRate = max` (144)
for smooth UI, and that window-level request out-votes the surface vote. **Fix `35dd636`:** new
`applyWindowPreferredRefreshRate(vrrRate)` (called from applyVrr) lowers the window preference to the matched
rate when VRR is capping, restores max otherwise. CI run `28332650876`. Retest: expect activeMode 144→60.
Lesson: an emulator that force-pins preferredRefreshRate to max blocks ANY app VRR vote — keep it in step.

---

## 2026-06-28 (s4) — 🐛➡️✅ VRR device-test #1: found + fixed the "panel won't drop" bug

Tested VRR on-device (AIO, OpenGL renderer, FPS cap 60, Match-refresh ON, game@60). Panel stayed at 144 Hz —
frameRateOverride showed our app un-throttled `{10492, 144}`. Root cause via dumpsys layer line
`60.00 Hz Default OnlySeamless`: our 60 Hz vote WAS placed correctly, but with **seamless-only** strategy, which
a peak-refresh 144 panel ignores. The code bug: `XServerView.applyFrameRateToSurface` only used the 3-arg
`setFrameRate(..., ONLY_IF_SEAMLESS)` when `FRAME_RATE_SEAMLESS_ONLY` was true, else fell through to the 2-arg
overload — which **also defaults to ONLY_IF_SEAMLESS**, so the "force" path was never taken.

**Fix `c29acc0`:** when SDK≥31, pass the strategy explicitly — `ONLY_IF_SEAMLESS` if seamless-only else
`CHANGE_FRAME_RATE_ALWAYS` (force the mode switch). CI run `28331250229`. Retest owed: reinstall, re-measure
(expect override→cap, activeMode drop). Notes: 40 fps is an awkward cap for a 144 panel (144/40=3.6) — use 60;
container was GL, also test Vulkan; if ALWAYS still won't drop it's device display policy, not our code.

**➕ Capability gating (`83da657`, CI `28332020195`):** the "Match refresh rate to FPS" toggle is now **greyed out** on devices that can't do VRR — `XServerView.isDisplayVrrCapable(display)` = SDK>=30 AND >1 distinct refresh rate among supported modes; gated in the in-game drawer (XServerDrawerState.vrrSupported, seeded at launch) + the ContainerDetail editor (probes the default display), with an "Unavailable on this display" hint. Single-mode/60Hz-only + pre-Android-11 → disabled. Build 28332020195 includes BOTH this AND the seamless-only fix `c29acc0`, so it supersedes 28331250229 — install THIS one for the retest. User's 144/120/90/60 panel = capable → toggle stays enabled.

**Same-device test protocol (1-thing-at-a-time):** VRR releases its vote on background (onStop→0), so measure
while the game is foreground — user stays in game, sends "go", switches back; I fire `sleep 12; dumpsys` to
capture with the vote reapplied. Confirm foreground via topResumedActivity.

---

## 2026-06-28 (s4) — 🆕 STEP 2: VRR / refresh-rate matching IMPLEMENTED (branch `feat/vrr-refresh-rate`, device-test owed)

Step 1 (debanding+NIS) merged to main earlier today; started Step 2 = make the panel refresh rate follow the
game FPS via `Surface.setFrameRate` votes (complementary to the FPS limiter: limiter=render rate, VRR=display
rate). One Surface-level vote on the parent SurfaceView covers all 3 host renderers (GL / Vulkan compositor /
SurfaceFlinger-ASR) since SF aggregates frame-rate votes over the layer subtree; existing Vulkan native child-SC
votes left intact.

5 commits on `feat/vrr-refresh-rate` (off main, pushed, NOT merged):
1. `4882473` XServerView.setDisplayFrameRate(float,int) — SDK_INT>=30 guard, picks active holder Surface,
   remembers last rate + re-asserts in surfaceChanged (added a holder callback to glSurfaceView which had none).
2. `4671c26` applyVrr()/reapplyVrr()/resolvedMatchRefreshRate() in XServerDisplayActivity — votes 0 when
   off/uncapped, `cap` normally, `cap×mult` in the lsfg-governs case; wired into applyFpsLimit + onStop(release)
   + onResume(reassert) + drawer onMatchRefreshChange.
3. `dcbefb5` Container `matchRefreshRate` extra (default ON) + shortcut resolver.
4. `2b603e5` drawer "Match refresh rate to FPS" toggle + XServerDrawerState flow.
5. `5ff90db` ContainerDetail editor switch + strings.

Reviewed rate logic + cross-layer contract names (sound; `getFrameGenMultiplier()` confirmed to exist).
CI run `28330068467` ✅GREEN (all flavors compile). No release/tag cut.

**▶️ DEVICE-TEST (user starting now):** `dumpsys SurfaceFlinger | grep -i frameRate` to confirm the panel takes
the vote. Verify: vote = cap when capped, cap×mult under lsfg, clears (0) when toggle-off/uncapped, re-asserts
bg→fg. **PREREQ: turn the FPS limiter ON + set a cap** (VRR only votes when capped; limiter is the existing
pre-feature, VRR just matches the panel to it). Needs a high-refresh panel (dumpsys shows the modes).
**Renderer priority:** Vulkan first (full stack, most likely to land) → OpenGL → SurfaceFlinger/ASR last + most
scrutiny (relies on SF aggregating the parent-Surface vote to the native child SC; if it doesn't land there →
do optional commit 6 = native ASurfaceTransaction_setFrameRate on the game child SC). Everyday use: Vulkan.
Risk: setFrameRate is a HINT (battery-saver may ignore).

## 2026-06-28 (s4) — ✅ VULKAN RETEST PASSED on new AIO torture cards → `feat/deband-nis` CLEARED TO MERGE

User built the AIO Graphics Test with the Banding scene + new "Scaling Tests >" sub-page (builder used the
exact scene ids from the brief: scaletest_combo/zoneplate/wedge/grid/checker/edges). Switched the AIO shortcut
to the **Vulkan** renderer (1280x720→1080p upscale) and drove it on-device:
- **Debanding (banding card, dark 0..16/255 ramp):** OFF = ~12 hard stair-step bands; ON = bands dissolved into
  fine dither grain. Max diff exactly 1/255, mean diff ~3x the smooth Space scene. The visual proof we couldn't
  get on Space/Nebula.
- **Scaling modes (combo card, grid patch sharpness std-dev):** none=linear 0.0590 (identical → None≡Linear
  label quirk), sgsr 0.0689, fsr 0.0693, **NIS 0.0757 (sharpest clean upscaler)**, nearest 0.0936 (blocky
  aliasing). All live-switch, all distinct; SGSR/FSR/NIS reconstruct cleanly above Linear.
- Host compositor confirmed Vulkan via drawer layout (CAS/Debanding). NOTE: AIO HUD "Renderer" line mislabels
  (showed "OpenGL" on the combo) — trust the container renderer, not that label.

**BOTH gate halves PASSED on Vulkan → `feat/deband-nis` is cleared to merge (awaiting user go-ahead).** Then
STEP 2 = VRR. Optional cleanup: None≡Linear label + CAS/Sharpen slider-snapping.

---

## 2026-06-28 — 🎨 `feat/deband-nis` FULLY DEVICE-PROVEN (NIS both renderers + Debanding) → MERGE-READY

**Branch `feat/deband-nis` (tip `cc3361f`, off main, PUSHED, NOT merged).** Detail memory =
`project_bannerlator_smooth_sharp_render_roadmap.md` (STEP 1). Device test driven via root bridge on the
SAME device (Adreno 750), AIO graphics test app, renderer = **OpenGL | DXVK**.

**NIS (NVIDIA Image Scaling, upscaler mode 7) — re-confirmed on GL (Space scene 720p→1080p):**
- ✅ **NO Adreno runtime-compile crash** selecting NIS on the GL renderer — the one big open risk (heavy
  unrolled NIS shader) is definitively cleared; scene keeps rendering. (Already proven on Vulkan in s2.)
- ✅ **Perf cost now measured** (was unbenchmarked): **290fps → 200fps (~31%)**, GPU load 72%→~86%. Still smooth.
- ✅ **Quality** (clean frozen-frame montage None/Nearest/Linear/NIS): NIS = crisp edges + detail preserved,
  distinct from blocky Nearest & soft Linear, no artifacts → NVScaler math correct. RMSE vs `none`: NIS 0.54%.
- ✅ **Sharpness slider** present, continuous, seeds 75, registers 0/100. Modulation confirmed qualitatively
  (clean pixel-delta elusive — the AIO Pause releases on a slider drag; first 4.9%/0.6% numbers were motion-contaminated, discarded).

**Debanding (terminal TPDF dither pass) — device-verified on GL Space scene (frozen-frame A/B):**
- ✅ Toggle works (drawer, below HDR); ON reveals "Dither strength" slider (seeds 100).
- ✅ **Max pixel diff = EXACTLY 1/255 (one 8-bit LSB)**, mean ~0.04/255 — textbook dither magnitude.
- ✅ **Mean brightness perfectly preserved** (0.282483→0.282532) — no bias/tint (hallmark of correct dither).
- ✅ Diff footprint = fine uniform noise across gradients (atmosphere/planet/moon), ~zero in black sky/saturated.
- ⚠️ **CAVEAT:** no dramatic "bands→smooth" before/after on Space — its gradients are dark/shallow + broken by
  stars/detail, so little gross banding to dramatize. Dither provably correct at LSB level; Space ≠ a showcase.
  **For a striking visual demo → AIO "Detailed Nebula" scene (next test).**

**🔎 SIDE-FINDING (cleanup candidate, unfixed):** in this build **None ≡ Linear EXACTLY** (RMSE 0) — base "None"
is doing bilinear; base-sampler labels (None/Linear/Nearest) worth a look. Pairs with the known CAS/Sharpen
slider-snapping inconsistency (GL 5-notch vs VK continuous).

**Debanding RE-TESTED on "Detailed Nebula" (s3, GL, frozen-frame A/B):** mechanism re-confirmed (game-area
max diff = exactly 1/255, mean-preserving); positive dither-footprint = fine stipple noise, ~8.8% of pixels in
the glow falloff nudged 1 LSB, densest at quantization boundaries. BUT even hard-amplified on the brightest
smooth ramp, OFF vs ON look identical — Nebula shows NO gross banding to dramatize either. CONCLUSION: AIO
test scenes render gradients clean enough that 8-bit banding is minimal in both Space & Nebula; debanding's
gain is real but sub-perceptual on THIS content (will matter on real games w/ heavy banding — fog/skyboxes/UE).
Build is dither-only on 8-bit chain (precision-bump step deferred). Note: whole-frame RMSE is meaningless here
(drawer changes between shots) — always crop to game area x>900.

**▶️ NEXT — ⛔ MERGE ON HOLD (user decision 2026-06-28):** do NOT merge `feat/deband-nis` yet. All prior
tests ran on AIO Space/Nebula scenes, which don't visibly band and barely separate upscalers (smooth content)
→ only proved debanding/scaling mathematically, not visually. GATE before merge: (1) AIO Graphics Test gets
its Banding scene (already built, commit `881f39e`, 1 past v1.6.0 — needs push+build+install) + new
Scaling-Test scenes (spec'd, not built — briefs in /sdcard/Download/SCALING_TESTS_BUILD_BRIEF.md +
BANDING_SCENE_FINDINGS.md) → (2) install new AIO binary → (3) **retest on the VULKAN renderer** with real
torture content (debanding on the dark 0..16/255 ramp, in-app dither OFF, scaling=None/1:1;
NIS/SGSR/FSR/FSR-Fit on zone-plate/wedge/grid at sub-native render-res). THEN merge if it passes → THEN STEP 2
= VRR. Optional: precision-bump (10-bit/R16F intermediate) would make debanding visibly stronger — revisit
only if a real game shows banding.

## 2026-06-28 — 🧩 BIONIC-FG: Track-3 FSR3 Optical Flow built + `.so` delivered for manual injection (NOT device-tested)

**Resume context for the bionic-fg frame-gen shader-pool / model-expansion effort.** Detail memory =
`project_bannerlator_bionic_fg_shader_pool.md`. Fork = `The412Banner/bionic-fg`, clone `/home/claude-user/bionic-fg-fork`.

**WHAT GOT DONE THIS SESSION:**
- ✅ **Track 3 = FSR3 Optical Flow added as runtime model 3.** Branch `feat/fsr3-optical-flow-model`
  (off `b0c2e5c`), commits `d6f4a09`(embed FSR3 OF SPIR-V idx66-69 + restore dropped `IsValidSpirv`) →
  `9f06376`(model-3 dispatch + clamp→3) → `5eb11a7`(GLSL src+docs) → `603d26e`(CI workflow). PUSHED, unmerged.
  Source = FidelityFX-SDK optical-flow passes (MIT), reimplemented subgroup-free GLSL for Turnip/no-DXC.
  15 OF passes → reuse model-0 warp/blend/synth back half. Models 0/1/2 byte-unchanged (additive).
- ✅ **Built `libbionic_fg.so` (arm64-v8a).** NEW self-build workflow in the fork `.github/workflows/build-so.yml`,
  CI run `28323607624` **GREEN** (NDK r26b 26.1.10909125 / android-26, matches app). No external patch needed —
  the single-device anti-deadlock fixes (fork commit `ac2f5c0`) are already an ANCESTOR of Track-3, so the
  source self-contains models 0/1/2/3 + single-device `create(device,…)` + manifest `disable_environment`.
- ✅ **Delivered to device for manual inject:** `/sdcard/Download/libbionic_fg.so` (6.3M, md5 `971e6aaa…`) +
  `/sdcard/Download/VkLayer_BIONIC_framegen.json`. User will inject + test LATER.

**🔑 CRITICAL ARCH FINDING (corrects prior records):** the app does NOT compile bionic-fg in its main NDK
build (no `add_subdirectory(bionic-fg)`); the layer ships as a **prebuilt asset**
`app/src/main/assets/bionic-fg/libbionic_fg.so`, built by the SEPARATE manual `build-bionic-fg.yml`. So the
recorded "model-2 app CI GREEN" only bundled the OLD prebuilt `.so` — **shipped layer = `9136405c` (Jun 21),
pre-model-1/2/3.** Models 1/2/3 + the shader_02 fix were NEVER in any shipped layer until this new `.so`.

**▶️ WHAT TO DO LATER (resume):**
1. **User injects + device-tests the new `.so`** — replace `<imagefs root>/usr/lib/libbionic_fg.so`,
   set `model = 3` in `…/home/<container>/.config/bionic-fg/conf.toml` (UI only writes 0/1), FG enabled.
   ⚠️ **CLOBBER CAVEAT:** `ImageFsInstaller.installBionicFgLayer` re-stages the OLD bundled asset whenever
   on-device size ≠ bundled size → inject right BEFORE launching or it reverts. Also worth testing model 2 (V2).
2. **Triage results:** FSR3 OF is compile-proven only — main risks = PERF (heavy SAD motion search; tunable
   search window `BR`/`SR` in `of3_flow.comp`) + visual correctness. shader_02 fix + model 2 also first-ever on device.
3. **If we want to ship for real** (not just inject): rebuild the bundled asset — either dispatch the app's
   `build-bionic-fg.yml` AFTER refreshing/removing the now-redundant 608-line `patches/bionic-fg-bannerlator-fixes.patch`
   (stale; fixes already in source), OR repoint that workflow to build the fork branch like `build-so.yml` does;
   then commit the new `.so` to `assets/`, bump versionCode (NOT a release per [[feedback_bannerlator_release_versioning_rule]]).
4. **Roadmap Tracks 4 & 5 BLOCKED on toolchains** (no sudo): Track 4 Lossless DXBC→SPIR-V needs `vkd3d-compiler`
   (meson/widl/spirv-headers all missing); Track 5 RIFE/IFRNet needs an `ncnn` build. Revisit when toolchains available.

## 2026-06-28 — 🛠️ BUILT: Debanding + NIS upscaler (branch `feat/deband-nis`, CI pending, NOT device-tested)

Implemented Track-1 step 1 from the master plan below. **Branch `feat/deband-nis` off main, 6 commits
`194b7b9`→`cc3e0e7` (+log `a53a226`), PUSHED, NOT merged, NOT device-tested.** Shaders compile clean
(glslangValidator), all cross-layer contracts reviewed+consistent. **CI ✅ GREEN — run `28319416413`
(build-artifacts.yml, all flavors; only a harmless Node-20 deprecation annotation).** First real compile of the
C++/JNI/Java/Kotlin passed. NEXT = on-device A/B (see ⚠️ below), then merge.

**DEBANDING** — terminal TPDF/IGN dither pass (float-only hash, Adreno-safe), `deband.frag`+header,
appended LAST as `FX_DEBAND`, registered in fxOn in BOTH planUpscaleFrame AND recordUpscalePasses
(known "scaling drops chain" bug avoided). `setDeband(bool,int strength)` JNI↔C++↔Java; GL `DebandEffect`
+ dedicated terminal slot in EffectComposer (render() + renderUpscaled()). strength 0..200 → /100 LSBs
(default 100 = ±1/255). Session-live (not persisted).

**NIS** — new upscaler mode int **7**. Faithful NVScaler port from authentic NVIDIA reference (MIT)
into single-pass `nis.frag` (edge map + 6-tap scale/USM + directional filters + CalcLTI + luma recolor);
**exact fp32 coef_scale/coef_usm baked as `const float[384]`** (transcribed programmatically from
NIS_Config.h, NOT hand-typed, first-row verified); fp32 path (no fp16/bitwise); NO 2nd descriptor binding.
Reuses existing sharpness slider. GL `NISEffect` + EffectComposer `case 7`. Engages only when render
res < display (like SGSR mode 3). Drawer: `7 to "NIS"` + mode-7 sharpness in both GL+Vulkan blocks.

**⚠️ Needs device-verification (agent's honest flags):** (1) NIS math not pixel-compared to a reference
NIS — A/B on the high-freq SPACE scene 720p→1080p, GL AND Vulkan. (2) GL NISEffect runtime-compiles a
heavy unrolled NVScaler + 2×384 const arrays on the Adreno GLES driver = the runtime-compile-crash class
the roadmap flags — DEVICE-TEST GL NIS specifically (Vulkan NIS is precompiled SPIR-V, safer). (3) NIS =
37 texture fetches/fragment, perf untested. (4) CI is the first real compile of the non-shader code.

## 2026-06-28 — 🗺️ MASTER PLAN: Graphics smoothness/sharpness roadmap + App theming/icons

> **STATUS: RESEARCH + RECON + 1 HTML MOCKUP + CODE-GROUNDED PLANS ONLY. NOTHING CODED, NOTHING
> COMMITTED, NOTHING DEVICE-TESTED.** This entry consolidates a full session of exploration into one
> plan. Deep detail (every file:line touchpoint) lives in the two memory files:
> `project_bannerlator_smooth_sharp_render_roadmap.md` + `project_bannerlator_theming_icons.md`.

Two parallel tracks scoped this session. Recommended first build = **debanding + NIS** (Track 1, small/visible/low-risk).

---

### TRACK 1 — SMOOTHNESS + SHARPNESS RENDERING

**User goal:** keep games EXTREMELY SMOOTH, NO FPS loss (ideally gain), + clarity/sharpness.

**Core principle (the answer):** it's a STACK, not one effect →
**render a bit lower → spatial upscaler (sharp) → VRR refresh-match (smooth) → debanding (clarity).**
That gains real FPS, cuts heat/power, adds sharpness, zero added latency.
**Myth busted:** frame-gen does NOT give free FPS — it inflates the HUD number while costing GPU + latency
(a perceived-smoothness layer, optional cherry-on-top for single-player base≥45fps).

**Recommended build order:**
1. **Debanding + NIS** ← START HERE (ready, ~6 commits, low-risk)
2. **VRR / `setFrameRate`** (refresh-rate matching; biggest smoothness-per-effort; SurfaceFlinger path best home)
3. **Curated shader-loader platform** (force-multiplier; compile `.spv` OFFLINE in CI = Adreno-crash-safe; permissive-licensed shaders only)
4. **Moonshot: DXVK depth → true SGSR2 on TAA/FSR2 games** (XL, staged, multi-repo)
5. Keep frame-gen (`bionic-fg`) gated/off-by-default, labeled as a latency trade.
**DROP:** BFI, Anime4K-CNN, pixel-art scalers, heavy CRT (royale), NPU/AI super-res — each costs FPS or doesn't fit.

**Scorecard (vs goal):** SGSR1/NIS/FSR1 ★★★★★ · CAS / shader-loader-platform ★★★★ · 3D-LUT / panel-calibration / estimated-MV-temporal ★★★ · Anime4K(CNN heavy) / pixel-art / adaptive-sharpen(already have CAS+RCAS) / heavy-CRT ★★ · BFI ★½ skip.

**READY-TO-BUILD PLAN — Debanding + NIS (GL + native Vulkan; ASR path runs neither chain):**
Shared plumbing: Vk post shaders `cpp/winlator/*.frag` + committed `*_frag.h` SPIR-V (gen via
`glslangValidator -V x.frag --vn x_code -o x_frag.h`, NO CI compile step). `VulkanRendererContext.cpp`
`createPostPipelines`~:552 / `recordUpscalePasses`:1074 / `planUpscaleFrame`:1235 / locked effect-chain
:1204-1229 / SINGLE-sampler `createDSLayout`:402-407 (don't add a 2nd binding) / PC range 88B.
**Whole chain = R8G8B8A8_UNORM 8-bit** end-to-end. GL = `renderer/EffectComposer.java` + `renderer/effects/*.java`.
Drawer `ui/XServerDrawer.kt` (options :772-775, sharpness slider :815-838). Effects SESSION-LIVE (not persisted).
⚠️known bug: an effect silently no-ops under scaling unless added to fxOn in BOTH planUpscaleFrame:1250 AND recordUpscalePasses:1087.
- **Debanding:** new `deband.frag` = terminal dither (IGN/TPDF, float-only hash, ~1 LSB, display space, no texture taps, Adreno-safe). Last effect-chain entry `FX_DEBAND` (always→swapchain). Vk pipeline + push-const + `setDeband` JNI/Java. GL `DebandEffect` + dedicated TERMINAL slot in EffectComposer (GL has no fixed order). Toggle + optional strength slider. Optional SEPARATE gated commit: bump offscreenFmt→A2B10G10R10/R16F (then off↔swap cross-bind needs split pipelines) — ship dither-only first.
- **NIS:** upscaler mode int=7. new `nis.frag` single-pass NVScaler, BAKE coef tables as `const float[]` in shader (no 2nd descriptor binding; fp32 not fp16). Reuse sharpness slider. Vk pipeline + planUpscaleFrame mode-7 branch (like SGSR mode3) + recordUpscalePasses single-pass; no new JNI. GL `NISEffect` + setUpscaler `case 7`. Drawer add `7 to "NIS"`. MIT ©NVIDIA.
- **Commits:** 1)shaders+headers+gen_shaders.sh 2)NIS-Vk 3)deband-Vk+JNI 4)NIS-GL 5)deband-GL 6)drawer+wiring 7)opt fmt-bump 8)opt persist. **Device-test SPACE scene 720p→1080p, GL AND Vulkan, A/B, confirm no FPS drop + composes with upscalers.**

**STAGED MOONSHOT — SGSR2 (XL, MULTI-REPO):** VERDICT — shipping a patched DXVK is mechanically fine
(we build/ship own DXVK `.tzst` in `assets/dxwrapper/`, extract `XServerDisplayActivity.java:2582`). REAL WALL =
guest→host transport: today only 1 buffer (color) crosses via DRI3 1-AHB=1-FD (`DRI3Extension.java:141`
`modifiers==1255`); the SENDER of extra buffers lives in the guest Wine/WSI build (NOT this repo → wine-compat +
guest build). PREREQ A.0: add a sub-1.0 internal-res lever (renderScale only supersamples ≥1.0 today). **Stage A
depth** (med, useful alone → unlocks DoF/SSAO): patch DXVK to export chosen depth as **R32F** AHB (sidesteps Adreno
depth-AHB limits), new DRI3 `modifiers==1256`, depth import variant, prove via depth-grayscale DEBUG pass. **Stage B
SGSR2** on TAA/FSR2 games (they give MV+jitter free): new 2-pass-FS shaders, persistent history buffer, 4-binding
descriptor for SGSR2 only, per-title jitter profile, auto-fallback SGSR2→SGSR1→passthrough, Vulkan-compositor-only
(ASR can't). **Stage C generic = research wall** (jitter can't be generically injected) — spike only.
**Smallest prototype:** 1 FSR2/TAA game → DXVK export depth-only R32F → accept 1256 → grayscale debug overlay;
if frame-aligned depth correct, transport PROVEN, rest is shader math; else STOP.

**SurfaceFlinger/ASR renderer (the 3rd host renderer) findings:** it hands the guest buffer STRAIGHT to the system
compositor — NO programmable pass, so the upscaler/effect shaders CAN'T live there (by design = its speed/battery win).
What it CAN uniquely add: `setFrameRate`/VRR (best home for #2 above), present-fence timing into the HUD, scaling/aspect
geometry modes, true HDR10 passthrough (speculative), layer alpha/damage. Already wired: setBuffer/geometry/visibility/zorder.

---

### TRACK 2 — APP THEMING + BUTTON ICONS

**Deliverable in hand:** interactive HTML preview (live theme switch, dark/light, accent slider, typography
before/after, 4 screens with icon fixes, offline-safe inline SVG) at device
`/sdcard/Download/bannerlator_theme_icons_preview.html` (+ scratchpad + `~/Downloads/`).

**Finding:** the app ALREADY has a theme engine (`ui/theme/Theme.kt`/`ThemePreset.kt` = 8 presets + HSV picker
`AppearanceScreen.kt`) → this is POLISH not a rebuild. Brand accent `#0055FF` (`Color.kt:8`).
**3 weaknesses:** light mode is DEAD CODE (`toLightColorScheme` exists, `_isDarkMode` hardcoded true, no toggle);
no Material You; ~730 hardcoded color literals bypass the theme (custom accent only paints PART of app until centralized).

**Proposals:**
- 3 new themes (live in the HTML): **★Midnight Cobalt** (rec, evolves brand blue; primary `#2F6DFF`/accent `#6FA8FF`/bg `#0E1117`) · **Phosphor Terminal** (retro CRT amber+green, dark-only) · **Carbon & Ember** (graphite+orange `#FF7A33`). Rec: ship Midnight Cobalt default + keep AMOLED + add Phosphor preset.
- **Typography ramp** (high ROI, ~10 lines `Theme.kt`): app forces weight 600 on ALL text → give head700/body400/label500.
- Un-disable light mode (setter+toggle); optional Material You preset API31+.
- **Icon gaps:** store detail pages (`store/{Steam,Epic,Gog,Amazon}GameDetailActivity.kt`) are TEXT-ONLY buttons → add `Icons.Filled.{PlayArrow,Download,Update,Delete,InsertDriveFile,CloudUpload}`; text "←"→`ArrowBack`; Epic "✓ Installed"→`CheckCircle`; game-card placeholder `OpenInNew`→`SportsEsports`; magnifier "✕"→`Close`. `material-icons-extended` already a dep. **Highest-ROI = store action-button icons (pure additive).**

**3-bucket app-wide reach verdict:** (a) AUTO once colors centralized = all out-of-game Compose UI + in-game magnifier;
(b) small recolor fix = in-game DRAWER `XServerDrawer.kt` (wrapped in theme, inherits fonts, but ~40 hardcoded colors → stays blue under a custom accent);
(c) feed accent MANUALLY = FPS/perf HUD (`widget/FrameRating*.java`, `PerfHudView.java`), on-screen controls (`InputControlsView.java`), legacy XML editors — via existing bridge `AppThemeState.getCurrentAccentArgb()`.

**Theming sequencing:** 1) typography ramp 2) store-button icons + back-arrows 3) centralize ~730 colors per-screen 4) Midnight Cobalt + Phosphor 5) light-mode toggle + optional Material You.

### NEXT MOVE
Start coding **Track 1 → debanding + NIS** (commits 1-6, CI-green, then user device-tests on the SPACE scene before SGSR2 spike). Everything above is durable in the two memory files; this log entry is the master index.

## 2026-06-27 — 🏷️ 2.0 STABLE RELEASE CUT

Merged the #18 turnip-ICD branch to main, bumped to **2.0 (versionCode 32)**, rewrote the README
"What's New in 2.0" + feature sections, and cut the **2.0 stable release** (run `28309799973`,
prerelease:false + make_latest:true → now the Latest the in-app updater offers; 3 flavor APKs +
update.json attached). Closed PR #24 (not merged).

**Everything in 2.0 since 1.9.2:** OpenGL renderer upscaler parity (SGSR/FSR/Sharpen) · sharpness
sliders retuned (0=off→100=max, SGSR doubled, Sharpen 5-stop snap, inverted-CAS fix) · OpenGL
filter-mode + glBlitFramebuffer plumbing (P4) · **game + container card redesign (#19)** ·
**auto-close session on game exit** · magnifier fix on Vulkan (#22) · FEXCore "Performance (TSO)"
preset (#20) · **Android-10 direct-ICD turnip driver (#18)**.

README/release note imageFS-reinstall reminder added (new turnip driver lives in imageFS).
Pinged issue #18 reporter (SD845/A10) to verify the new `turnip-26.1.0` driver — issue left open
pending their confirmation (no A10 device locally).

---

## 2026-06-27 — #18 direct-ICD turnip path for Android <11 (built, CI-green, awaiting reporter A10 test)

Diagnosis: the reporter's A10/SD845 problem is the driver LOADING MECHANISM — Bannerlator loads
turnip via adrenotools (linkernsbypass hook, needs ~A11+); Winlator loads it as a plain system
Vulkan ICD (works on any Android). Also closed PR #24 (strlcpy/snprintf — original code already
safe).

Branch `feat/turnip-icd-direct-android10` off main (`f43a319`), commits `60038cf` + `971c415`,
CI `28309292459` ✅ green, **NOT merged, NOT device-tested** (no A10 hardware here). New driver
option `turnip-26.1.0` (Winlator's Mesa Turnip 26.1.0, ICD format) that installs the freedreno
ICD + .so into the guest, points `VK_ICD_FILENAMES` at it, and **skips the adrenotools env**
entirely — bypassing the A11+ hook. Picker filter special-cased to gate on `isAdrenoGPU()` (the
normal adrenotools probe is exactly what fails on A10). Adrenotools path untouched; default still
turnip-sdk36. Top residual risk: host-vs-guest path assumption (if proot-remapped, library_path
would need a guest path). NEXT: reporter verifies a CI build on their SD845 → then merge.

---

## 2026-06-27 — Implement open issues #22 (magnifier) + #20 (FEX Performance+TSO preset)

gl-upscaler-parity merged to main (`6d5f75b`). Branch `fix/issues-22-magnifier-20-fextso` off
main, CI build `28308479676` ✅ green. **User device-confirmed both work → MERGED to main (ff
`6d5f75b..ecb8646`, branch deleted, no tag); GitHub auto-closed #22 and #20.**

**#22 magnifier (`d7a736e`):** `showMagnifierOverlay()` cast the renderer to `GLRenderer` and
no-op'd the zoom callback for anything else → on the default Vulkan renderer the overlay opened
stuck at 100% with dead +/- buttons. Now uses the `HostRenderer` interface (get/setMagnifierZoom
implemented by all 3 renderers; Vulkan applies it live via `updateTransform`). The other
GLRenderer cast in `showScreenEffectsDialog` is correct (effects are GL-only) — left as-is.

**#20 FEX "Performance (TSO)" preset (`55fb879`):** fetched the issue screenshot — the reporter's
preset is Performance with **only `FEX_TSOENABLED=1`** (vector/halfbarrier/memcpy TSO stay off,
x87-reduced + multiblock on), the lightweight single-TSO-flag variant. Added `PERFORMANCE_TSO`
to `FEXCorePreset` + a `getEnvVars` block + `getPresets` entry + `performance_tso` string.
Additive, no DB migration; auto-appears in the spinner and Compose container/shortcut editors.

NEXT: CI green → device-test (#22 magnifier on a **Vulkan** container; #20 pick preset + launch a
TSO game) → merge to main.

---

## 2026-06-27 — Open-issue triage + scopes (#22 magnifier, #20 FEX TSO preset) — QUEUED

Scoped while the gl-upscaler-parity slider CI built. To be implemented on a **fresh branch off
main AFTER the gl-parity sliders device-test + merge** (user: "after we device test we will
tackle them both").

**#22 — magnifier doesn't work / zoom — ROOT CAUSE FOUND (high confidence):**
`XServerDisplayActivity.showMagnifierOverlay()` (~line 3339) casts the renderer to
**GLRenderer only** and the zoom callback early-returns when it's not GL. The **default
renderer is Vulkan**, so the Magnifier overlay opens, shows 100%, and the +/− buttons are dead.
Confirmed clean fix: `HostRenderer` interface already declares `get/setMagnifierZoom` (all 3
renderers implement it) and `VulkanRenderer.setMagnifierZoom` calls `updateTransform()` → zoom
applies live. **Fix = use the `HostRenderer` reference instead of the GLRenderer cast** (~3
lines, 1 file). Optional: `ASurfaceRenderer.setMagnifierZoom` lacks a redraw trigger (add
`updateScene()`). Device-test on Vulkan (can fold into the slider session).

**#20 — Add FEX "Performance + TSO" preset:** the built-in PERFORMANCE preset sets
`FEX_TSOENABLED=0`; many games need TSO. **Fix = add a new "Performance (TSO)" built-in preset**
(Performance base + the 4 TSO flags on: TSOENABLED/VECTORTSOENABLED/MEMCPYSETTSOENABLED/
HALFBARRIERTSOENABLED=1, X87REDUCEDPRECISION=1, MULTIBLOCK=1) across `FEXCorePreset.java` +
`FEXCorePresetManager.java` (getEnvVars + getPresets) + `strings.xml`. No DB migration (presets
stored by id). Verify exact flags vs the reporter's screenshot.

**Also noted:** #18 (bundle brunodev Winlator turnip 26.1.0 for A10/SD845 — packaging easy but
adrenotools load may need A11; needs an A10 device) and PR #24 (bounded strlcpy/snprintf in
android_sysvshm.c — review + merge candidate).

---

## 2026-06-27 — GL upscaler parity: device-test, inverted-slider fix, sharpness-range tuning

**Branch:** `feat/gl-upscaler-parity` (off main `ec3bcb0`). Phase 1 (SGSR/FSR/Sharpen on the
OpenGL EffectComposer + drawer Scaling-mode picker, commits `efd5f4f`→`327ab9d`) was already
CI-green (`28306036455`). This session = device-test + fixes. NOT merged.

**Device test (build 1.9.2 vc31, AIO-Graphics-Test-32bit = OpenGL + 1280x720 on 1080p panel,
DX11 SPACE scene, frozen-frame A/B via drawer Pause):** GL parity LIVE — all 6 scaling chips
produce DISTINCT output on the GL renderer (frozen-frame re-upscale works). RMSE vs None:
Linear 0% (≡None ⇒ default sampling IS bilinear) · Nearest 1.51% (blocky) · Sharpen 0.36% ·
SGSR 0.68% · FSR 0.79% (crispest). Cursor stays crisp under Nearest = PASS (host cursor
exempt from point-scale). Zoomed montages confirm visual distinctness.

**🐛 Bug found + fixed (`52c7092`):** the upscale "Sharpness" slider was INVERTED for the
Sharpen mode (AMD CAS) — raising it SOFTENED. Root cause = `FSREffect`'s level scale is
inverted (level 1 = CAS sharpness 0.90 = sharpest, level 5 = 0.12 = softest) but both CAS
call sites mapped slider straight onto level. Fix: `EffectComposer.buildPickerCas():339`
`level=(1-upscaleSharpness)*4+1` + `XServerDisplayActivity.onSgsrUpdate:2088`
`level=(100-sharpness)/25+1`. SGSR (EdgeSharpness=1+s*1.333) and FSR RCAS (stops=1-s) were
already correct → untouched. CI `28307366153` triggered then cancelled (superseded below).

**✅ Slider-effectiveness tuning DONE + committed (graphics-vulkan-engineer, GL + Vulkan):**
every sharpness slider now spans **0 = nothing (neutral, no sharpening; upscale still runs)
→ 100 = max**, ZERO shader recompiles (all host-side push-constant / pass-gating math).
Final effective values, slider 0/50/100:
- GL SGSR EdgeSharpness **1.0 / 2.33 / 3.67** (`1.0+s*2.666` — span doubled, neutral floor 1.0)
- GL FSR RCAS lobe scale **0.0 / 0.5 / 1.0** (`clamp(sharpness,0,1)` — 0 = true passthrough)
- GL Sharpen mode 6 (snapped {0,25,50,75,100}) **OFF / CAS 0.50 / CAS 0.90** (0 = no CAS pass)
- GL "Sharpen (CAS)" toggle (snapped) **OFF / 0.50 / 0.90**
- Vulkan SGSR edge **0.5 / 2.5 / 4.5** (`0.5+s01*4.0` — span doubled)
- Vulkan FSR/Sharpen RCAS con.x **0.0 / 0.5 / 1.0** (`upscaleSharpness01` linear, 0 = passthrough)
- Vulkan CAS toggle **OFF / 0.5 / 1.0** (`casOn = casEnabled && casSharpness>0`)
Snap = `XServerDrawer.kt` IntSlider `steps` override (5 stops only in mode 6 + always for the
Sharpen(CAS) toggle; SGSR/FSR/Vulkan-Sharpen stay continuous). No over-drive past RCAS/CAS
ceiling → no ringing. Commits `beebb17` (GL SGSR-double + FSR 0=neutral) · `fac47ed` (GL Sharpen
5-stop snap + 0=OFF) · `0718c39` (Vulkan mirror). CI build **`28307792454`** ✅ green all 3 flavors.

**✅ GL device-test PASSED (AIO space scene, OpenGL|DXVK Adreno 750, live drawer-open method):**
Sharpen slider **snaps to 0/25/50/75/100** (tap ~38% → snapped to 50). FSR slider **0 = true
passthrough** (crop png 218 KB, softer than None's 245 KB, no sharpening) → **100 = strongly
sharp** (420 KB, +92%). SGSR **0→100 = +18% png**, montage shows visibly crisper limb/coastlines
(doubled range). 0 = neutral confirmed. Vulkan mirror = code-verified (shared host logic) but
not device-tested this session (AIO shortcut is OpenGL). Note for next time: this AIO test
**exits the scene on BACK while paused**, so the frozen method was abandoned — open the drawer
once via BACK while running, then switch chips live without pause/BACK. NEXT: merge gl-parity to main.

**❌ Dropped per user:** a persisted per-shortcut "upscaling on/off" toggle. Clarified that
720p→1080p plain stretch is ~free (final-blit sampler); only opt-in SGSR/FSR cost GPU and are
already default-None + session-live. User said "leave the upscaling alone."

---

## 2026-06-27 — P4 "Lean GL path" (render-upgrades roadmap, final phase) — steps 1+3

**Status:** branch `feat/p4-lean-gl-1-3` off main `35fd80d` (pushed). 2 commits. CI
`28304623016` (`build-artifacts.yml`, all 3 flavors) running. Baseline main build
`28304103719` ✅ green (known-good fallback). NOT merged; device-test pending.

**Context:** Vulkan render-upgrades (P1 SGSR/FSR framework, P1b/1c CAS/HDR/sliders, P2 the
5 GL effects → Vulkan, + native-mutex) are all DONE + on main. P3 (ReShade `.fx` engine)
DROPPED. **P4 = the last phase**, and it targets the *Java GL renderer only*.

**Recon (graphics-vulkan-engineer, read-only):** the roadmap's framing — "reduce
GLSurfaceView overhead" — is mostly the wrong target. In the default config (DRI3 on) the
game frame is **already zero-copy** on GL via AHardwareBuffer→EGLImageKHR (`GPUImage`), so
there's no per-frame CPU upload to kill. EGL context is already GLES3 (`XServerView.java:89`)
despite `GLES20.*` calls → GLES3 APIs available today. Real gaps: `setFilterMode` is a dead
no-op on GL; no low-res→cheap-upscale path; full-frame `glTexSubImage2D` only on the
SHM/DRI3-off/cursor path; effect chain renders base into a full-res FBO even for 1 effect.
GameHub's `libxserver.so` is proprietary but its "direct scanout" rides the same AHB/EGLImage
primitives we already own → P4 = clean-room reimpl with in-tree CAS/SGSR/FSR, nothing
license-blocked. Ladder = 5 rungs; this batch = the low-risk 1–3.

**Implemented (this batch):**
- **Step 1 — `f7e0670` setFilterMode real on GL.** `GLRenderer.java`: new `windowTexFilter`
  field; `setFilterMode(int)` maps `2→GL_NEAREST else→GL_LINEAR` (matches Vulkan convention),
  applied in `renderDrawable` ONLY when `material == windowMaterial` so the **cursor stays
  LINEAR**. Launch hook `XServerDisplayActivity.java:1785`
  `renderer.setFilterMode(container.getRendererFilterMode())` gated `instanceof GLRenderer`
  (was dead/unreachable before — nothing called `HostRenderer.setFilterMode`; Vulkan drives
  filtering via `setUpscaler`). `getRendererFilterMode()` verified to exist (`Container.java:497`).
- **Step 2 — PBO async upload — ❌ DROPPED.** First CI failed to compile
  (`Texture.java:153 int cannot be converted to Buffer`): this project's compileSdk exposes
  only the `Buffer` overload of `GLES30.glTexSubImage2D`, not the int-offset (PBO) variant →
  a PBO can't feed the texture, so no benefit (`glTexImage2D`-with-offset would realloc every
  frame, slower than the sync path). Cleanly reverted (`Texture.java` diff vs main now empty).
  Deferred, not delivered. Lesson: don't assume Android GLES30 int-offset texSubImage exists.
- **Step 3 — `c085dd9` glBlitFramebuffer for trivial copy stage.** `EffectComposer.render()`:
  null-material (pure-copy) pass now goes through `blitReadBufferTo` (GLES30
  `glBlitFramebuffer`, COLOR_BUFFER_BIT, LINEAR, scissor disabled) instead of program-bind +
  textured quad. ALL real shader passes (Color/FXAA/Toon/CRT/NTSC/CAS) + the source-less
  `drawFrame` scene render are UNCHANGED — only the degenerate null-material branch changed
  (which also fixes an old clear-then-draw-nothing→black bug). Bit-identical with-effects output.

**Deferred:** Step 4 (low-res render-target → cheap upscale = the actual "GameHub feel" win,
higher risk: letterbox/scissor + keep cursor full-res) and Step 5 (drop GLSurfaceView for an
owned EGL/SurfaceView present thread). Step 2 (async CPU-path upload) would need a non-PBO
mechanism given this SDK's bindings.

**Confidence:** step 1 = would-work/needs-device-proof (sampler state only, no fast-path
regression); step 3 = would-work (bit-identical for shipped effects). No SDK in the agent env
→ correctness proven by CI compile + device test, not local build.

**Next:** CI green → device-test (GL renderer + Filter toggle nearest/linear; confirm cursor
stays sharp; effects still composite) → merge to main. No tag/release (artifacts only).

## 2026-06-27 — #19 follow-up: Layout L wired + A/L card chooser

**Status:** branch `fix/shortcut-name-overflow` (pushed). Commit `324bb4a` (L + chooser) +
audio-drop follow-up edit. Compile CI `28300618235` (`main.yml`) running on `324bb4a`;
audio-drop fix needs a re-run after its commit. NOT merged.

**Ask:** user said "wire up L so I can choose between the two" — make the list-view card style
user-selectable between the existing layout A and the chosen layout L.

**Implementation:**
- `ShortcutsViewModel.kt`: persisted `useLayoutL` pref (`shortcuts_prefs` / `list_card_layout_l`,
  default `false` = A) mirroring `isGridView`; `setUseLayoutL()`.
- `ShortcutsScreen.kt`:
  - Top-bar **A/L toggle** — an "A"/"L" Text `IconButton`, shown only in list view (hidden in
    grid). Keyed the top-bar-actions `LaunchedEffect` on `(isGridView, useLayoutL)` so the toggle
    reflects live state (was `Unit` → captured stale values; the existing grid icon only updated
    via content recompose).
  - List branch now picks `ShortcutItemLayoutL` vs `ShortcutItem` on `useLayoutL`.
  - New `ShortcutItemLayoutL`: same 48×64 poster cover; subtitle = `container · resolution`;
    PRIMARY `FlowRow` of bright `CompChip`s — renderer (`ChipRendColor`), DXVK, frame-gen
    (`ChipFgColor`, "Bionic-FG" / "LSFG-VK"); SECONDARY `FlowRow` of `SecondarySpec` (7dp colour
    dot + dimmed `OnSurfaceVariant` 10sp label) — driver, VKD3D, backend (`ChipCpuColor`).
  - Renderer / frame-gen / backend resolved via `shortcut.getExtra(key, container.getX())`
    (`getRenderer` / `getFrameGenEngine` / `getEmulator`); backend name via
    `R.array.emulator_entries` + `StringUtils.parseIdentifier`.
  - **Refactor:** extracted the shared ⋮ menu into `ShortcutOverflowButton` (own `menuExpanded`),
    now used by BOTH A and L so the menu can't drift.
- **Audio dropped** from L's secondary (follow-up edit) to match `docs/shortcut_card_L_final.html`
  — lets driver · VKD3D · backend sit on one row. First commit `324bb4a` wrongly included it.
- **Deferred:** backend preset suffix ("FEXCore · TSO" / "Box64 · Perf" in the mockup) — needs the
  async `Box64PresetManager` / `FEXCorePresetManager`, too heavy to resolve per list-card; backend
  shows the emulator name only for now.

**Next:** commit audio-drop fix → CI green → device-test (both layouts render + pref persists
across the toggle and app restart) → merge → close #19. ⚠️ save-before-device-test rule.

## 2026-06-27 — Issue #19 "Name of games is empty" + game-card redesign

**Status:** branch `fix/shortcut-name-overflow` (pushed, NOT merged). Layout A build CI `28299970224` running.

**Root cause (#19):** in `ShortcutsScreen.kt` list-mode `ShortcutItem`, the right-aligned
resolution+DXVK/VKD3D info column had no width bound. In a `Row`, unweighted children are
measured before the weighted name column gets the remainder, so a long version string (e.g.
a DXVK/VKD3D nightly with a commit id in its name) grew unbounded → collapsed the weighted
name column to 0 width ("name is empty") AND pushed the trailing ⋮ overflow menu off-screen.

**Iterations on the branch:**
- `1dd8d4d` interim: capped info column `widthIn(max=120dp)` + ellipsize. Device-tested by user
  → fixed the blank name but now TRUNCATED the component versions (not acceptable).
- `e496040` interim: split DXVK/VKD3D onto own lines, wrap to 2 lines, cap 140dp.
- `b598adb` (current tip) **Layout A redesign**: replaced the info column with a 3:4 poster
  cover (reuses `shortcut.icon`, same bitmap the grid uses) + name/container + graphics
  components as colour-coded chips on a wrapping `FlowRow` (`CompChip` helper + 4 chip colors,
  `ExperimentalLayoutApi`). Long version strings wrap to another chip line / grow the row
  taller instead of clipping. CI building (`28299970224`).

**Design exploration (HTML mockups, rendered via headless chromium, saved to /sdcard/Download):**
- `docs/shortcut_card_layouts.html` — 6 layouts A–F (poster, square-icon+chips, hero banner,
  16:9 spec grid, two-tier stat strip, current-for-comparison).
- `docs/shortcut_card_layouts_dense.html` — 6 denser layouts G–L that ALSO show renderer
  (OpenGL/Vulkan/SurfaceFlinger), frame-gen (off/bionic/lsfg), audio (ALSA/PulseAudio) and
  x86 backend (FEXCore/Box64/wowbox64 + box64/FEX preset). Real values pulled from arrays.xml
  + ShortcutsScreen.
- `docs/shortcut_card_L_final.html` — **user likes layout L** (bright primary chips
  renderer·DXVK·frame-gen + muted secondary line driver·VKD3D·backend), **audio dropped per
  user so the secondary line fits one row / card is shorter**. Resolution moves into subtitle.

**NEXT:** user wants to SEE the layout A build on device first, but LIKES L → likely wire L
(swap the FlowRow chip cloud for L's two-tier primary/secondary) on the same branch. L needs
3 more shortcut extras resolved in ShortcutItem: `renderer`, `frameGenEngine`, `emulator`
(+ box64Preset/fexcorePreset). Keys all confirmed present.

## ⚠️ WORKFLOW RULE — save before device tests / heavy jobs

We **device-test on the same physical device that hosts the working session** (PRoot/Termux + the app under
test are on one device). A device test, app install, screenshot/diff batch, or large agent/workflow can OOM and
crash the session, losing any un-saved context. **Always flush memory + this progress log + commit BEFORE running
a device test or heavy/memory-load job, and update continuously — not just at the end.** Memory + this log are the
durable checkpoint; the live session is volatile.

## 2026-06-27 (latest) — 🚀 Release 1.9.2 (stable patch)

Opacity fix device-confirmed working by user → cut **1.9.2** stable patch. Bumped `app/build.gradle`
versionCode 30→31, versionName 1.9.1→1.9.2 (`84b6bc1`), pushed main, dispatched `release.yml`
(run `28295471682`) with tag `1.9.2`, title `Bannerlator 1.9.2`, make_prerelease=`false`
(→ prerelease:false + make_latest:true). Workflow builds all 3 release APKs + generates/attaches
update.json (vc31) so the in-app updater offers it to stable users.

**What 1.9.2 ships (since 1.9.1):** full Vulkan effect suite — P1 SGSR + FSR1 upscalers (`5f5a4a0`),
P1b sharpen + render-scale, P1c CAS + fake-HDR + sharpness sliders, P2 FXAA/Toon/Color/CRT/NTSC screen
effects; Native-Rendering ↔ presets mutex; Linear default scaling mode; on-screen-controls overlay-opacity
drop-shadow fix (`1d9439e`). Plain numeric tag = stable per the versioning hard rule (patch X.Y.Z allowed
on explicit user request).

**✅ PUBLISHED — release run `28295879200` succeeded.** 1.9.2 is **Latest**, prerelease=false, all 3 flavor
APKs + `update.json` (vc31) attached → in-app updater offers the OTA to 1.9.1 (vc30) installs. Release body
rewritten to the polished 1.9.1-style layout (logo → ✨What's New → 📥Downloads → 🙏Credits → changelog)
with a full **graphics credits table**: SGSR ([SnapdragonStudios/snapdragon-gsr](https://github.com/SnapdragonStudios/snapdragon-gsr), BSD-3),
FSR/Sharpen ([GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR), MIT),
CAS ([GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-CAS](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-CAS), MIT),
FSR-Fit/compositor blueprint ([utkarshdalal/GameNative](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative), GPL-3.0 — approach reimplemented, not copied),
and HDR/FXAA/Toon/CRT/NTSC/Color (upstream Winlator-Ludashi GLES2 effects ported to Vulkan). Attributions
sourced from the bundled shader headers at `app/src/main/cpp/winlator/*.frag`, which retain their upstream
license text. ⚠️First run `28295471682` FAILED at the update.json step — `release_notes` had literal
double-quotes that broke the bash `NOTES="..."` assignment (exit 127); re-ran with shell-safe plain notes.

**📝 Release-copy accuracy pass (post-publish body edits, no rebuild).** User flagged the marketing line
("only Winlator fork with both real spatial upscalers and a complete post-processing chain on Vulkan —
previously all OpenGL-only"). Verified in source against the other forks and corrected it:
- **GameNative** = FSR1-only on the Vulkan compositor (the blueprint we built on).
- **WinNative** (`/home/claude-user/winnative`) = **SGSR-only** on its Vulkan compositor (`cpp/winlator/vk/shaders/sgsr1.frag`
  + `SGSRUpscaler.java`) **plus an effect chain broader than ours** (sharpen/CRT/HDR/NTSC+NTSC2/Toon/ColorAdjust/
  ColorGrade/ColorBlind/Vivid/Scanlines/Pixelate/Natural); its `fsr.glsl` is only in the cnc-ddraw wrapper, not the compositor.
- So "real upscaler on Vulkan" and "full effect chain on Vulkan" are **NOT** unique to us; only **both SGSR *and* FSR1
  together** on the default path is. Also the upscalers were brand-new, not "previously OpenGL-only" (only the effects were).
- Rewrote the 1.9.2 intro: dropped the superlative, credited GameNative as FSR-on-Vulkan pioneer, noted SGSR exists in
  other Pluvia forks, claimed only the verified differentiator (both upscalers together). Also split What's New so
  **Render scale (supersampling)** is labeled *set before launch* (container/shortcut) vs the drawer-live upscalers/effects.
  Applied via `gh release edit 1.9.2 --notes-file` (APKs/update.json/Latest unchanged).

## 2026-06-27 — Native-mutex merge + on-screen controls opacity shadow fix

**1. Native-Rendering ↔ presets mutex MERGED to main.** User device-tested the latest `feat/vulkan-native-mutex`
build and confirmed it good. Fast-forwarded `main` `506ac6a`→`1c9c576` (`3ed78bb` mutex + `1c9c576` toast
black-box fix + Linear default scaling mode), pushed `origin/main`, deleted the feature branch local + remote.
The full Vulkan graphics program (P1 / P1b / P1c CAS+HDR / P2 effects / native-mutex) is now all on main.

**2. On-screen controls opacity bug FIXED** — `app/.../inputcontrols/ControlElement.java`, commit `1d9439e` on
main, CI run `28294667670` ✅ GREEN (all 3 flavors). **Device-test PENDING.**
- *Symptom (user, device screenshots 100% vs 6%):* at low Overlay Opacity the A–F keyboard strip fades fully, but
  the 4 compact keys MRB/BKSP/SPACE/ENTER keep a solid blue filled square while only their label text fades.
- *Root cause (pulled both screenshots to confirm):* NOT the fill paint — the GameHub `fillColor` already tracks
  `gameHubDim`. It was the **drop shadow**: the BUTTON draw path calls `paint.setShadowLayer(..., 0x401C85FE)`
  (hardcoded blue, alpha `0x40`) before the fill, and that shadow alpha never scaled with opacity. At low opacity
  the fill/stroke/text vanish but the blue glow persists — on the compact `SQUARE` keys it reads as a solid blue
  background; on the wide `ROUND_RECT` pills (A–F) it smears out and looks invisible. That asymmetry = the bug.
- *Fix:* added `int shadowColor = Color.argb((int)(0x40*gameHubDim*effectiveOpacity),0x1C,0x85,0xFE)` and used it
  in both `setShadowLayer` calls (trigger + non-trigger BUTTON paths). 0% opacity now truly vanishes. Only the
  BUTTON case has a shadow; STICK/D_PAD/TRACKPAD/RANGE_BUTTON unaffected.
- *Next:* CI green → install → device-test opacity at low values across both key shapes.

## 2026-06-27 — Phase 2: remaining GL screen effects → Vulkan post chain

**Branch `feat/vulkan-effects-p2`** (off `main` `71dceca`), commit `5dfcdbf` + fix `77c6b76`. Builds on the
now-merged P1/P1c Vulkan post-process framework. NOT merged.

**Device test (space scene):** all 5 effects work individually — Color/Brightness (washes out at 95), Toon
(edge outlines + posterized), CRT (RGB chromatic-aberration on stars), NTSC (horizontal chroma bleed). NTSC+CRT
2-effect combo renders clean. **Bug found + fixed (`77c6b76`):** with a *scaling* mode (SGSR/FSR/Sharpen/downscale)
active, the screen effects were silently dropped (toggles on, image clean) — `recordUpscalePasses`' local `fxOn`
only checked `cas||hdr`, so the scale pass treated itself as final and skipped the chain. Now includes all 7 effects.
(This also fixes P1c CAS/HDR, which had the same gap on the scaling path.) **Fix rebuilt: branch tip `aed6cde`, CI build `28290066760` ✅ green (all 3 flavors).** **Fix device-verified on the
space scene:** SGSR + CRT now shows the CRT fringing/scanlines on the upscaled image (was dropped pre-fix), and
SGSR + NTSC + CRT (3-deep chain) renders both effects cleanly — no black screen/corruption. **Phase 2 is
device-proven** (Color/Toon/CRT/NTSC visually confirmed + the scaling-chain fix; FXAA wired, subtle by nature).
Branch tip `0593385`. **Merged to main (ff `eee9d57`), branch deleted; artifacts build `28291121833` ✅ green.**

**Phase 3 (ReShade-style `.fx` engine) DROPPED 2026-06-27.** The upscalers (SGSR/FSR/Sharpen/downscale) are
resolution-reconstruction passes wired into the compositor — not ReShade-style fixed-res filters, so they stay hardcoded
(the headline differentiator). The cosmetic effects (CAS/HDR/FXAA/Toon/Color/CRT/NTSC) are fully covered by the curated
hardcoded set with better perf/reliability on mobile/Turnip. A data-driven engine only pays off for user/community
extensibility without rebuilds, which isn't a goal. **Effects work is complete.** Remaining: P4 (lean native-GLES2 GL path)
+ the queued overlay-opacity button-fill bug. The Vulkan renderer now carries the full stack: SGSR/FSR/Sharpen upscalers +
CAS + fake-HDR + FXAA/Toon/Color/CRT/NTSC, all on the default path.

Ported the 5 remaining GL-only screen effects onto the **same** Vulkan post chain as composable controls,
at full GL parity:
- **Color** — Brightness / Contrast / Gamma sliders (replicates `ColorEffect.java`: brightness `clamp(s/100,-1,1)`,
  contrast `clamp(s/100,0,2)` so negative contrast is a no-op like GL, gamma `clamp(0.1,5)`; neutral 0/0/1 ⇒ pass skipped).
- **FXAA · Toon · CRT · NTSC** — toggles (GL shader math ported verbatim).

**Locked canonical chain order** (best results): `composite → scale (SGSR/FSR) → FXAA → Toon → Color → CAS → HDR
→ NTSC → CRT → swapchain` — AA first, stylize/grade the clean image, sharpen, bloom, then the output-medium
emulation last (NTSC analog signal, then the CRT tube). The fixed 2-effect chain from P1c was generalized to an
ordered 7-effect list, ping-ponging `fx1`/`fx2` (2 buffers suffice); the last active effect writes the swapchain,
earlier ones write `offscreenRenderPass` fx targets (auto-barriers). Engages even at scaling mode 0/1/2.

5 new shaders (`fxaa/toon/color/ntsc/crt.frag` + compiled `*_frag.h`), 10 new pipelines (Off/Swap per effect),
all PC structs ≤ 28 B (≤ the 88 B shared range, unchanged). Plumbing mirrors P1c: 5 JNI entry points,
`VulkanRenderer.setScreenEffects(b,c,g,fxaa,toon,crt,ntsc)`, `XServerDialogState.onVulkanScreenEffectsApply`,
a "Screen Effects" subsection in the Vulkan drawer block, and launch-seed + callback wiring in
`XServerDisplayActivity`. **No-op safety:** with zero new effects enabled, control flow is identical to current main
(no regression to shipped P1/P1c behavior). Touched: `{fxaa,toon,color,ntsc,crt}.frag`(+`.h`),
`VulkanRendererContext.cpp/.h`, `vulkan_jni.cpp`, `VulkanRenderer.java`, `XServerDialogState.kt`, `XServerDrawer.kt`,
`XServerDisplayActivity.java`. `docs/render_upgrades_report.html` already shows P2 in-progress + the locked chain order.

---

## 2026-06-27 — Vulkan CAS + fake-HDR + sharpness sliders (Phase 1c) + on-device upscaler proof

**Branch `feat/vulkan-cas-hdr`** (off `feat/vulkan-upscaler-sgsr-fsr` tip `80c6d56`), commit `4fecbc6` +
docs `181500c`. **CI build `28287630767` ✅ GREEN** (standard/ludashi/pubg). NOT merged. Device-test pending.

**On-device upscaler verification (the resume from the smooth-blob test).** Re-ran the frozen-frame A/B on the
**DX11 "space" scene** (textured planet + coastlines + dense starfield), 720p container → 1080p panel, build 1.9.1:
the scaling modes are now clearly and usefully distinct (RMSE vs None ≈ 6× the smooth blob's <0.4%):

| Mode | RMSE vs None | On screen |
|---|---|---|
| Nearest | 0% (≡ None) | hard stair-step jaggies on the planet limb (point) |
| Linear | 1.79% | jaggies smoothed but whole frame softened |
| **SGSR** | 1.75% | edges cleaned, stars/detail stay crisp — sweet spot |
| **FSR / FSR-Fit** | 1.82% | same family as SGSR |
| **Sharpen** | 2.46% | brighter/punchier (RCAS), keeps base jaggies |

The earlier "no visible difference" was **bad test content** (smooth SDF blob, no high-freq edges), not a bug —
spatial upscalers are an edge-cleanup whose effect grows with the upscale ratio. "More RMSE" ≠ "better"; fidelity to
a native render is the goal. This test motivated the P1c sharpness sliders (strength was locked at 0.25).

**Phase 1c — three new composable Vulkan post controls + one rename:**
- **CAS toggle + "CAS Sharpness" slider (0–100, default 60)** — the same AMD CAS the GL path uses (`cas.frag`
  ported from `FSREffect.java`), layered on top of any scaling mode, runs even at native res.
- **HDR toggle** — the same fake-HDR (`hdr.frag` ported from `HDREffect.java`, HDRPower 1.30, binary).
- **"Sharpness" slider** for scaling modes SGSR/FSR/FSR-Fit/Sharpen — unlocks the real upscaler sharpness
  (was hard-coded 0.25 RCAS stops; default slider 75 keeps 0.25). SGSR `EdgeSharpness` moved const→push-constant.
- **GL "SGSR" → "Sharpen (CAS)"** — the GL toggle was never SGSR; it's AMD CAS sharpening at native res. Label-only.

Pipeline: `recordUpscalePasses` rewritten to chain `composite → scale → CAS → HDR → swapchain`, with optional
`fx1`/`fx2` intermediates ping-ponged through `offscreenRenderPass` (auto-barriers via its baked subpass deps; no
hand-rolled `vkCmdPipelineBarrier`). Cross-binding the swapchain-render-pass scale pipelines into an
`offscreenRenderPass` fx target is legal — both passes use `VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM` (format-compatible). All PC
structs ≤ 88-byte range. Touched: `cas/hdr/sgsr.frag` (+ compiled `*_frag.h`), `VulkanRendererContext.cpp/.h`,
`vulkan_jni.cpp`, `VulkanRenderer.java`, `XServerDialogState.kt`, `XServerDrawer.kt`, `XServerDisplayActivity.java`.
Drawer-only / session-live (no DB persist), like the scaling mode. `docs/render_upgrades_report.html` updated with
the device-test results + P1c.

## 2026-06-27 — Vulkan spatial upscalers + sharpen + supersampling (Phase 1/1b)

Branch `feat/vulkan-upscaler-sgsr-fsr` (NOT merged). First fork with real SGSR **and** FSR1 upscaling on the
default Vulkan renderer, plus native-res sharpen and supersampling — in one app. Full design/provenance log:
`docs/SGSR_HDR_VULKAN_PLAN.md`; per-renderer summary `docs/render_upgrades_report.html`.

**Built a Vulkan post-process framework** in `app/src/main/cpp/winlator/VulkanRendererContext.cpp` (offscreen
composite target at game res → post/upscale pass → swapchain), then layered features on it:

- **Scaling mode** (in-game drawer, live, Vulkan-only): None / Linear / Nearest / **SGSR** / **FSR** / **FSR (Fit)** /
  **Sharpen**. Modes via `VulkanRenderer.setUpscaler(int)` 0–6. Upscalers engage only when the game renders below
  display res; **Sharpen (6)** runs FSR RCAS at any res incl. native.
- **Supersampling ("Render scale")** — pre-launch container + per-game-shortcut setting Off/1.25x/1.5x/2x (stored via
  `renderScale` extra, no DB migration). Launch multiplies the X11 render res (aspect-preserve, clamp 7680x4320, even
  dims); compositor runs a new Lanczos-2 `downscale.frag` via `setHqDownscale(true)`. DSR/OGSSAA-style.
- **Per-renderer Graphics tab** — shows ONLY the active renderer's controls (OpenGL→SGSR/HDR+ScreenEffects;
  Vulkan→Scaling mode; SurfaceFlinger→"no enhancements" note) instead of greying out the rest.

**Shaders bundled** (offline-compiled to `.spv` C-array headers, license headers retained): SGSR 1.0 (Qualcomm,
BSD-3), FSR1 EASU+RCAS (AMD, MIT), Lanczos downscale. Approach for FSR-in-compositor / FSR-Fit credited to GameNative.
**HDR deferred** (Android WSI rarely exposes an HDR10 surface; revisit later).

**Commits:** `5f5a4a0` native upscaler + drawer · `28ab22d` per-renderer tab · `c3cbe49` Phase 1b sharpen+supersampling
· docs `33ad5f4`. **CI:** Phase 1 GREEN (`28276691564`, `28277238762`); full Phase-1b build `28277821185` ✅ GREEN
(all 3 flavors). **DEVICE-UNTESTED** — next step is on-device: sub-native upscale modes, native-res sharpen, 1.5x
supersampling, and per-renderer tab. Then **Phase 2** = port GL effects (FXAA/CRT/Toon/NTSC/color) to Vulkan.

CI for this repo is MANUAL: `gh workflow run build-artifacts.yml --ref <branch>`.

## 2026-06-25 — 1.9 STABLE cut ✅ (SurfaceFlinger renderer + DXVK 3.0 / Vulkan 1.4)

Merged `feat/surfaceflinger-renderer` to main (ff `d915798`), bumped to **1.9 / versionCode 29** (`eb39c2b`),
and cut **1.9 stable** (release run `28215839109`, `make_latest`, `update.json` attached → in-app updater
offers it on the stable channel). User explicitly authorized promoting to stable ("release 1.9").

**Shipped in 1.9:**
- **SurfaceFlinger (ASR) renderer** — experimental third host renderer, opt-in behind a reboot-risk warning
  dialog, default off. Ported from GameNative PR #1582 (André Vito) on StevenMXZ's scanout work.
- **DXVK 3.0 / Vulkan 1.4** option in the Turnip/Wrapper Driver Configuration.
- **Fixes:** per-game DXVK/VKD3D download sheet no longer hides behind the settings dialog; perf HUD labels
  SurfaceFlinger correctly.

**No imagefs reinstall required** — the 1.9 diff is purely app-side (renderer engine, a bundled native lib,
an env-var option, UI). No `imagefs/`, `assets/`, or `imgVersion` change; existing containers are untouched.

Release description was rewritten to the 1.8 layout with credits to GameNative (André Vito) + StevenMXZ for ASR.

## 2026-06-25 — SurfaceFlinger (ASR) renderer Phase 1 ✅ WORKING + device-proven (branch `feat/surfaceflinger-renderer`)

Took the SurfaceFlinger renderer from "selectable skeleton" (Phase 0) to a working scene compositor
that renders real D3D games fullscreen via Android SurfaceFlinger — no GL/Vulkan compositor. Ported
from GameNative PR #1582 (André Vito, on StevenMX's scanout work), adapted to Bannerlator's X-server API.

**Build-up:** scene engine (`ASurfaceRenderer` implements `WindowManager.OnWindowModificationListener`
+ `Pointer.OnPointerMotionListener`; `updateScene` walks the window tree under XLock → one SurfaceControl
layer per window via `nativeRegisterWindowSC`/`nativeUpdateWindow` in a begin/apply transaction; frames
pushed via `nativeSetWindowBuffer`) + additive `PresentExtension` ASR branch (routes the game AHB to the
SC; Vulkan/GL paths untouched).

**The hard debugging (device, Adreno 750, GTA IV + AIO Graphics Test, DXVK 3.0 + VK 1.4):** game ran
(audio) but showed a small top-left window. On-device logging (filtered logcat to a file — wine logs flood
the buffer) proved the whole Java chain worked (8000+ `ASR_Present`/pushes with valid AHBs, SC registered,
visible). Two stacked root causes, both fixed:
- **`Drawable.DRAWABLE_ASR_MODE`** (`98861c8`): port GameNative's flag so every Drawable is backed by a
  composer-compatible `GPUImage` AHB at construction (`data = AHB mapped memory`) — required for
  SurfaceFlinger to scan out. Wired `setAsrMode(true/false)` per renderer in `XServerView.initRenderer`.
- **Geometry** (`bf292bf`): `computeWindowRect` used the normalized GL `sceneScaleX` (~1.0), pinning the
  game at native size in the corner. Map through `viewTransformation.aspect` (surface-px-per-X-px, e.g.
  1.5×) + letterbox offset instead → fills the surface.
- **HUD** (`bf292bf` + `c4f6e5f`): wired `ASurfaceRenderer.setHudFrameTick` (FPS was blank — the tick was
  Vulkan-only) + fixed the renderer label (`XServerDisplayActivity:1710` binary vulkan?:OpenGL → +SF case).

**✅ DEVICE-PROVEN** (build `28213017959`, screenshot-every-5s/60s): GTA IV menu renders FULLSCREEN under
ASR, HUD reads `SurfaceFlinger | DXVK | … FPS: 398 2.5ms`, stable. **✅ GL/Vulkan regression pass:** all
three renderers render GTA fullscreen with correct labels/FPS (Vulkan 300, OpenGL 295, SurfaceFlinger 398)
— additive edits don't disturb GL/Vulkan, global ASR flag clears correctly. **✅ Debug logging stripped**
(`bb64f2b`, clean build `28213752314`).

Branch tip `bb64f2b`, carries the merged Vulkan 1.4 commit. **NOT merged** — awaiting call: merge to main vs
Phase 2 polish first (CPU desktop chrome compositing, cursor, fps-limit tearing — none block game render).
Process note: always `git push` BEFORE dispatching a CI build (a build was once cut from the pre-push commit;
verify via `gh run view <id> --json headSha`). 1.9-pre prerelease when cut.

## 2026-06-25 — DXVK 3.0 Vulkan 1.4 option ✅ merged + SurfaceFlinger renderer Phase-0 spike 🚧

**Context:** DXVK 3.0 shipped (all 4 `.wcp` flavors on The412Banner/Nightlies). DXVK 3.0 **hard-requires
Vulkan 1.4** (mandatory bump from 2.x's 1.3 — verified vs the release notes). The Turnip/Wrapper Driver
Configuration "Vulkan Version" dropdown capped at 1.3, so the wrapper exported `WRAPPER_VK_VERSION=1.3.x`
and DXVK 3.0 refused to init even on a VK1.4-capable driver.

**Fix — Vulkan 1.4 option (`785fe2b`, branch `feat/vulkan-1.4-dxvk3`, CI `28205826581` ✅ → ff-merged to
main 2026-06-25).** One-line: added `<item>1.4</item>` to `arrays.xml` `vulkan_version_entries`. Default
kept **1.3** (safe; 1.3-only drivers/A6xx unaffected) — user picks 1.4 manually for DXVK 3.0. Value flows
generically: dialog → `graphicsDriverConfig` `vulkanVersion=` token → `XServerDisplayActivity:2149` appends
the driver patch → `WRAPPER_VK_VERSION` env. **Proved load-bearing at the binary level:** disassembled the
bundled `libvulkan_wrapper.so` — `wrapper_GetPhysicalDeviceProperties` does `getenv("WRAPPER_VK_VERSION")` →
`sscanf` → `VK_MAKE_API_VERSION` → `str` into `pProperties->apiVersion` (offset 0), the exact field DXVK 3.0
gates on. Caveat: override is unconditional (no clamp to real driver max) → on A6xx (Turnip caps at 1.3)
picking 1.4 would lie to DXVK = footgun; default-1.3 avoids it. All 4 Nightlies DXVK release bodies updated
with the VK1.4 note + "Current version: 3.0". Driver side: The412Banner/Banners-Turnip builds report
**Vulkan 1.4.354** (Mesa main, `TU_API_VERSION=VK_MAKE_VERSION(1,4,..)` for chip≥7); device Adreno 750 (A7xx)
gets the 1.4 path. DEVICE-UNTESTED end-to-end (DXVK 3.0 launch w/ 1.4 selected).

**SurfaceFlinger renderer (ASR) — Phase-0 spike (branch `feat/surfaceflinger-renderer`, commit `068c3a5`,
CI `28208898551`).** 3rd host renderer ported from GameNative PR #1582 (André Vito; built on StevenMX's
scanout work). Confirmed our `cpp/winlator/VulkanRendererScanout.cpp` is **byte-identical** to GameNative's —
Steven's scanout foundation already in-tree. Spike = compiles + selectable (NOT a working compositor):
native `cpp/asurfacerenderer/` (JNI repackaged to `com_winlator_star_renderer`) → `libasurface_renderer.so`
via main CMakeLists; skeleton `ASurfaceRenderer` implements `HostRenderer` + loads lib + creates/destroys the
SF context on the surface lifecycle (per-window scene compositing deferred to Phase 1); selection wired in
`XServerView.initRenderer(String)` + `XServerDisplayActivity` (API<29 → Vulkan fallback) + "SurfaceFlinger"
added to container + per-game renderer dropdowns. NOT merged; device-test pending. See
`reference_gamenative_surfaceflinger_renderer` memory for the full Phase-1 plan.

## 2026-06-25 — 1.8 STABLE cut ✅ (updater picker fix + in-app OTA proven on a real stable)

Closed out the 1.8 cycle. One code blocker remained from the updater work, then cut stable.

**Picker correctness fix (`f1729a7`, branch `fix/updater-picker-sort`, CI `28200393133` ✅ → ff-merged to
main, branch deleted).** GitHub's list-releases API does **not** return pure newest-first — it pins the
`make_latest` release to the top, then lists the rest by date. Confirmed live: the API returned
`[1.7 (latest, published 01:46), 1.8-pre2 (published 20:30), 1.8-pre1, 1.6…]`. `UpdateManager.pickNewestWithUpdateJson`
took the **first** array element carrying `update.json`, which worked only because 1.7 had none (skipped).
Once 1.8 stable carried `update.json` + `make_latest`, it would have **shadowed a newer 1.9-preN** in the
prerelease channel. Fix = parse all releases into a list, `sortWith(compareByDescending { optString("published_at","") })`
(ISO-8601 sorts lexicographically = chronologically), then walk for the first with `update.json`.

**1.8 stable cut (user explicit go-ahead — required by the hard rule).** Bumped `versionCode 27→28` +
`versionName "1.8"` (`376e5fd`), dispatched `release.yml` with `release_tag=1.8 release_number=1.8
make_prerelease=false` → workflow auto-sets `prerelease:false` + `make_latest:true`. Release run
`28201699881` ✅. Verified: **Bannerlator 1.8 = Latest**, 1.7 demoted; assets = 3 flavor APKs +
`update.json`; **`releases/latest/download/update.json` now resolves to vc28/1.8** (stable updater
baseline live). Release body rewritten to match the 1.7 layout (logo / tagline / What's-New sections /
downloads table / credits / collapsible changelog) — intentionally **no reinstall-imageFS warning** since
1.8 is app-side only (HUD + updater), nothing changed in imageFS.

**✅ In-app OTA proven on a real stable cut:** a device running **1.8-pre2 (vc27)** auto-updated in-app to
**1.8 stable (vc28)** — the full updater loop (detect → download correct flavor → install) confirmed on a
genuine stable transition, not just pre→pre. Main tip `376e5fd`.

**1.8 ships:** GameHub-style perf HUD (2nd selectable overlay + live swap) · in-app updater (auto-install
+ optional prerelease channel) · setup-screen branding fix · updater picker fix. Next cycle → 1.9-preN
prereleases until an explicit stable call.

---

## 2026-06-25 (later) — In-app updater + prerelease channel (✅ device-proven, shipping via 1.8-preN)

Built a GitHub-releases-based **in-app update system** (modelled on the BannersComponentInjector /
BannerHub updater). Merged to main; being device-tested via prereleases.

**Core — `core/UpdateManager.kt`:** fetches `releases/latest/download/update.json`, compares
`BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE` (the integer is the source of truth, NOT the tag string), caches to
`cacheDir` (offline-safe), picks the flavor APK by `BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID`, downloads via the
existing `HttpUtils` (reuses `DownloadProgressDialog`) and installs through the existing
`com.winlator.star.tileprovider` FileProvider. Install-permission guarded (`REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`,
Android 8+). **UI lives in 3 places:** Settings → new "Updates" section (readout, Check, Download &
install, Notify toggle); About dialog (latest-version line + "Update now"); app-wide amber home banner
(honours notify + skip-version). Manifest got `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` + an `external-cache-path`;
`release.yml` generates + attaches `update.json` per release.

**"Include pre-releases" toggle (Settings, default OFF):** OFF = stable path (`releases/latest` only ever
resolves to a non-prerelease). ON = `checkViaApi` → GitHub releases API (`?per_page=30`, prereleases
included) → newest release carrying an `update.json` → its own asset URLs. **Gotcha: api.github.com 403s
without a `User-Agent`** → added one to `HttpUtils`' string fetch. `release.yml` gained a
`make_prerelease` input (sets `prerelease` + inverts `make_latest`); `update.json` now attaches to EVERY
release so the toggle has data.

**Versioning rule established (hard rule):** stables = plain numeric tag (`1.8`,`1.9`),
`prerelease:false` + `make_latest:true` — the ONLY thing the default updater offers. Everything between
stables = `X.Y-preN` (`1.9-pre1`,`pre2`…), `prerelease:true`, no make_latest, until explicitly promoted.
`versionCode` ticks up on EVERY build.

**Branding fix (`fix/setup-splash-branding`, merged):** the shared `DownloadProgressDialog` (first-launch
imagefs setup + HttpUtils downloads incl. the update download) hardcoded **"Star Bionic"** + **"Bionic
V1.1"** — caught from a device screenshot (pulled via root bridge). Title → `@string/app_name`
(per-flavor), version → `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME` (dynamic, new `@+id/TVVersion`). Also cleaned the
leftover "Star Bionic" in the unused `about_dialog.xml`.

**Build log:**

| Step | Commit / Tag | CI Run | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Updater core (Settings/About/banner) | `41d7c06` | `28193511129` | ✅ green |
| Include-prereleases toggle + UA fix | `19b7e36` | `28195066124` | ✅ green |
| Merge + bump → 1.8-pre1 (vc26) | `ca87892` | `28195824422` (release) | ✅ published (prerelease) |
| Setup-screen branding fix | `b11814c` | `28197124387` | ✅ green |
| Merge + bump → 1.8-pre2 (vc27) | `2b10f53` | `28197773910` (release) | ✅ published (prerelease) |

**✅ DEVICE-PROVEN:** on the installed vc25 build, toggling Include-prereleases ON surfaced 1.8-pre1, and
Update downloaded + installed + launched it end-to-end. 1.8-pre2 (vc27) cut to re-test + carry the
branding fix. Stable 1.7 users untouched throughout (`releases/latest` still 404s for update.json since
1.7 predates the feature; no pre is make_latest). Main tip `2b10f53`.

**🐛 KNOWN latent bug (NOT yet fixed):** GitHub `/releases` API is not reliably newest-first — it hoists
the `make_latest` (stable) release to the top. `pickNewestWithUpdateJson` takes the first array element
with an `update.json`, which works while only prereleases carry it, but once a **stable + a newer
prerelease coexist**, the older stable would win over the newer beta for toggle-on users. **Fix before
cutting 1.8 stable: sort releases by `published_at` (fallback `created_at`) DESC before scanning.**

## 2026-06-25 — GameHub HUD: device-test crash fix + full in-game drawer mirror (branch `feat/gamehub-perf-hud`)

Continued the GameHub HUD port from P0–P4 (entry below) into on-device testing. Two follow-ups, neither merged.

**1. First-launch crash FIXED (`4808d51`, build `28179250039` ✅ green).** Installing the correct P4
build and enabling the GameHub HUD crashed the container + app the moment the overlay first refreshed.
Logcat (pulled via the root bridge):
```
FATAL EXCEPTION: Thread-6
android.view.ViewRootImpl$CalledFromWrongThreadException: Only the original thread that
  created a view hierarchy can touch its views. Expected: main Calling: Thread-6
    at com.winlator.star.widget.PerfHudView.update(PerfHudView.java:350)
    at ...XServerDisplayActivity$6.onUpdateWindowContent(:798)   ← X-server epoll thread (PresentExtension)
```
Root cause: `PerfHudView.update()` runs on the X-server epoll thread and called `requestLayout()` /
`invalidate()` directly — neither is thread-safe. `FrameRating` never hit this because it marshals via
`post(this)`. Fix = `post(refreshOnUi)` where `refreshOnUi = () -> { requestLayout(); invalidate(); }`.
The other two view-touching methods (`applyConfig`, `setVertical`) already run on the UI thread
(`runOnUiThread` at `XServerDisplayActivity:561` / tap handler). **Gotcha for future HUD work: anything
reached from `onUpdateWindowContent` is on the epoll thread → only `post()` / `postInvalidate()`.**

**2. In-game side drawer now fully mirrors the container dialog (`7437c3d`).** User wanted the same
settings/toggles in the in-game HUD tab. Before, `XServerDrawer.kt` → `HudContent` only had the classic
subset (scale/opacity + 6 toggles) and its `buildConfig()` **omitted `hudStyle` and every gamehub-only
key** — so changing anything in-game while the GameHub HUD was active stripped `hudStyle=gamehub` from the
saved container config (persisted via `onFpsConfigApply` → `setFPSCounterConfig` + `saveData` at
`XServerDisplayActivity:567`), reverting to the classic HUD on next launch. Rewrote `HudContent` to mirror
`FpsCounterConfigDialog` exactly: GameHub-style switch, FPS-graph / Power / GPU-model / dual-battery
toggles, skin/color/outline 3-stop chips (new drawer-styled `HudChipRow`, no FilterChip import), opacity
slider, and the **identical key set** (emits both classic + gamehub metric key names) so the drawer and
the pre-launch dialog are interchangeable. Metric/skin/scale/opacity changes apply **live** via
`onFpsConfigApply` → `perfHud.applyConfig` (UI-thread safe). The classic↔gamehub **view swap** still
applies on next launch only (the view is chosen at launch; a caption notes this) — live view-swap is a
possible follow-up.

Branch tip `7437c3d`. Combined build CI `28181338752` (in progress at time of writing). **NOT merged.**
Next: device-test the `28181338752` build — (a) enable GameHub HUD (master **Show FPS** must also be on),
launch → confirm renders without crash + tap flips orientation + metrics live; (b) open in-game drawer
HUD tab → confirm all GameHub controls present, apply live, and no revert-to-classic → tune dims/colors →
merge to main.

## 2026-06-25 — GameHub-style performance HUD port (branch `feat/gamehub-perf-hud`) — P0–P4 coded, device-test pending

A second, **selectable** in-game performance HUD modeled on GameHub 6.0.9's overlay, alongside the
existing `FrameRating`. User scope: **full parity** (17 controls), **per-container**, **all 3 skins**.
Clean reimplementation (our own View + data we already collect) — no GameHub code/assets copied.

Recon: 3 Explore agents over the jadx decompile (`/home/claude-user/gamehub-6.0.9-jadx`, GameHub =
Compose-Multiplatform `com.xiaoji.egggame`, obfuscated). HUD = plain Canvas/Paint/Path (no Compose/GL/
native for visuals; ref legacy View `o6m.java`). Two layouts (horizontal pill / vertical list), FPS line
graph (last 50 samples, peak clamped ≥60, 30fps guide), Classic/Neon/Mono skins, color-intensity
(0.72/0.88/1.0), text outline (off/1.0dp/1.4dp), scale 0.6–1.4, opacity. Most metrics already collected
by `FrameRating`; FPS comes from our own frame counter (GameHub's `libxserver.so` shm not needed).

- **P0 plan** `docs/GAMEHUB_PERF_HUD_PORT_PLAN.md`.
- **P1+P2** new `widget/PerfHudView.java` — self-contained Canvas view: both layouts, per-field colors,
  FPS graph, all 3 skins, color-intensity, outline, scale, opacity; parses the `fpsCounterConfig`
  KeyValueSet; `update()` frame-tick mirrors `FrameRating`; tap-toggle + drag. Standalone compile CI
  `28175068799` ✅ green.
- **P3** new `widget/HudMetrics.java` — shared collector: GPU% / temp / RAM / power+charging ported from
  `FrameRating`, **plus** overall CPU usage % (`/proc/stat` delta) and the dual-battery power fix (sums
  `battery`+`bms`+`main` `current_now` with abs()).
- **P0 wiring** `XServerDisplayActivity.java` — when `hudStyle=gamehub`, creates a `PerfHudView`
  (WRAP_CONTENT params) instead of the two `FrameRating` views; handled at every HUD site (create /
  show-hide / frame-tick update / live applyConfig / `toggleFpsHudOrientation`→`perfHud.setVertical` /
  DX-API detect→`setEngineLabel` / `_MESA_DRV_GPU_NAME`→`setGpuModel`). Classic path unchanged.
- **P4 config UI** `ContainerDetailScreen.kt` `FpsCounterConfigDialog` — "GameHub-style HUD" switch
  (`hudStyle`) + 9 metric toggles + dual-battery + scale/opacity sliders + skin/color/outline 3-stop
  FilterChip selectors (`HudToggleRow`/`HudThreeStop`); toggles emitted under both classic + gamehub key
  names; bounded scroll via `heightIn(screenHeight*0.7)`.

Config keys (per-container `fpsCounterConfig`): `hudStyle=classic|gamehub`, `hudMode`, `showFPS`,
`showFPSGraph`, `showCPUUsage`(+`showCPULoad`), `showGPULoad`, `showRAM`, `showPower`,
`showTemp`(+`showBatteryTemp`), `showEngine`(+`showRenderer`), `showGpuModel`, `hudDualBattery`,
`hudSkin=classic|neon|mono`, `hudColor=soft|mid|vivid`, `hudOutline=off|soft|strong`, `hudScale` (50–150),
`hudOpacity` (0–100), `hudTransparency` (classic).

Branch tip `b2fc55e`. Full artifact build CI `28176206476` (in progress at time of writing). **NOT merged.**
Next: verify build green → device-test (enable "GameHub-style HUD" in a container's FPS settings, launch,
confirm render + tap-flip + live metrics) → tune dimensions/colors on device → merge to main. Caveats:
HUD dimensions are first-guess; CPU% is overall-device (not per-game); in-game `XServerDrawer.kt` config
not extended (container-detail dialog only; orientation tap still works in-game).

## 2026-06-25 — Two HUD fixes merged to main (`ac6abbb`)

- **Fake FPS offset removed** (`19c9982`): stripped a fudge offset from `FrameRating.java` +
  `FrameRatingHorizontal.java` so the on-screen FPS reads true when native rendering is on.
- **Vertical HUD tap area fixed** (`ac6abbb`): the vertical `FrameRating` was added to the root
  `FrameLayout` with no LayoutParams, inheriting FrameLayout's `MATCH_PARENT × MATCH_PARENT` default — so
  its tap-to-toggle hit area covered the whole screen (a tap far from the overlay flipped orientation).
  Fixed with explicit `WRAP_CONTENT` + top-left gravity. Both built green (`28172970834`) and
  fast-forward-merged to main; `fix/fps-hud-tap-area` deleted. No release cut (still versionCode 25).

## 2026-06-24 — Steam detail-page revamp — branch `feat/steam-detail-revamp` (stacked on launch branch)

User asked to modernize the Steam game detail page. Picked all of: stored-info rows, last-played,
real playtime hours, bigger sheets (DLC/branch/cloud/add-home), and more robust/fluid download buttons +
accurate progress bars.

- **Chunk 1 DONE** (`SteamGameDetailActivity.kt` `ca90b96`): renders **developer / genres /
  metacritic** (already stored in our GameRow but previously hidden) + a **"Last played"** row from the
  install-dir timestamp (`relativeTime()`); reworked the downloads UI — **animated rounded progress bar**
  in a card with an **indeterminate "Preparing…" phase** and a separate %/bytes line; new
  `DetailActionButton` (48dp, rounded, disabled dimming) + `DetailInfoRow`. Pure UI/Compose.
- **Chunk 2 — real playtime hours: ABANDONED + REVERTED** (`ee85bf9`). Tried owned-games via JavaSteam
  unified messages (`SteamOwnedGames.kt`) but the API fought compilation (needed protobuf-java for the
  proto `GeneratedMessage` supertype; then `Player.getOwnedGames` return type is neither `Future` nor
  `CompletionStage` — `.get()`/`.toCompletableFuture()`/`.result`/`.body` unresolved). User chose to drop
  playtime recording; timestamp-based "Last played" (chunk 1) stays. Removed the file + Playtime row +
  protobuf-java dep.
- **TODO (remaining follow-up):** **bigger sheets** — DLC/depot manager, beta branch picker,
  cloud-save export/import/sync, add-to-home-screen (port from ref4ik `SteamLibrarySheets.kt` /
  `SteamGameActions.kt`).

**RESUME SNAPSHOT (2026-06-24, for crash recovery):** Two stacked feature branches, NONE merged, all
device-test-pending:
  • `feat/steam-pluvia-launch` (off main) — Pluvia Phase 1 coldclient launch, steps 1-4, commits
    `ff13265`/`1c6839d`/`f0b6106`/`73834d6`, all compile-green. Drawer "Steam" = unchanged store; adds
    emulation launch.
  • `feat/steam-detail-revamp` (stacked on the launch branch) — tip `ee85bf9` — detail revamp chunk 1
    only (chunk-2 playtime reverted). CI `28143904501`.
NEXT WHEN RESUMING: (1) confirm CI `28143904501` green; (2) device-test on the test device — Steam
download → add a steam_api game with "Steam emulation" → confirm Goldberg launch; detail page shows
dev/genres/metacritic/last-played + fluid progress; (3) optionally build the bigger sheets;
(4) then decide merge order (launch branch → main first, then rebase revamp → main). ref4ik clone at
`/home/claude-user/scratchpad/ref4ik`. Full design = `docs/STEAM_PLUVIA_PORT_PLAN.md`.

**imageFS reinstall?** No — for the Steam coldclient + detail revamp, updating 1.7 → next release needs
NO imageFS reinstall. The coldclient loader is a separate bundled APK asset extracted at runtime into the
existing imageFS (not baked into `imagefs.txz`), and the detail revamp is app-only. (Only carryover: if a
user never reinstalled imageFS for 1.7's ffmpeg-8, that 1.7 recommendation still applies.)

## 2026-06-24 — Pluvia Steam: Phase 1 (Goldberg/coldclient launch) — branch `feat/steam-pluvia-launch`

Implementing the recommended **Option A** from `docs/STEAM_PLUVIA_PORT_PLAN.md` — **UPGRADE the
existing Steam store** (browse/login/download/UI stay ours, unchanged from 1.7), adding only the
Goldberg/coldclient **launch** so SteamAPI titles actually run. ⚠️ User confirmed scope 2026-06-24:
NOT a full replacement (drawer "Steam" still opens our existing store). All work on the branch; NOT
merged; device-test pending.

- **Step 1 (`ff13265`)** — bundled asset `experimental-drm.tzst` (coldclient loader x32/x64 +
  emulated steamclient DLLs + extra_dlls; PE → host-arch independent) + `SteamClientManager.kt`
  (extracts it into the imageFs Steam dir). Ported from REF4IK/winlator-ref4ik- (GPL-3.0).
- **Step 2 (`1c6839d`)** — `SteamLaunchUtils.kt`: self-contained **offline** Goldberg helpers
  (writeColdClientIni, generateInterfacesFile, writeOfflineSteamSettings, backupSteamclientFiles,
  putBackSteamDlls, setupLightweightSteamConfig, skipFirstTimeSteamSetup, ensureSteamappsCommonSymlink).
  No dependency on ref4ik's Room SteamService; account read from our `steam_prefs`.
- **Step 3 (`f0b6106`)** — launch glue: `prepareColdClientLaunch` + `writeGameSteamSettings` +
  `StarLaunchBridge.addSteamGameToLauncher`/`writeSteamShortcut` (container picker → activateContainer →
  prepare env → write `.desktop` `Exec=wine C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamclient_loader_x64.exe`
  with `game_source=STEAM` Extra Data). Prefix model = `activateContainer` repoints the `home/xuser`
  symlink → active container; corrected ref4ik's `skipFirstTimeSteamSetup` to take `imageFs.rootDir`.
- **Step 4 (`73834d6`)** — Compose UI: `SteamGameDetailActivity` shows a Compose AlertDialog
  ("Steam emulation" vs "Run .exe directly") after exe resolution → routes to the coldclient path or
  legacy raw path; `SteamGamesActivity` defaults its add paths to the emulation route.

Compile CIs: steps 1+2 `28141425805` ✅ green; steps 3 `28141874404` / 4 `28142049412` ⏳ pending.
**Next:** device-test a steam_api title (download → add with Steam emulation → boots under Goldberg)
→ then merge to main. Possible follow-ups: preferred-container, PICS LaunchInfo exe detection, cloud saves.

## 2026-06-24 — 🚀 Release 1.7

Cut **Bannerlator 1.7** (`versionName 1.7`, `versionCode 25`, commit `30c869c`). Version bumped in
`app/build.gradle`; splash screen reads `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME` so it shows "V 1.7" automatically
(no hardcoded version strings anywhere). README version line + "What's New in 1.7" updated (1.6 notes
demoted to "Previously in 1.6"). Release build = workflow "Nightly Manual Release Build" run
`28140854161` (tag `1.7`, builds standard/ludashi/pubg release APKs) — ✅ GREEN. **PUBLISHED**
https://github.com/The412Banner/Bannerlator/releases/tag/1.7 with full notes; 3 assets each ~588.7 MB
(`Bannerlator-1.7-standard.apk` 588704729 B / `-ludashi.apk` 588704765 B / `-pubg.apk` 588704647 B).
Everything merged to main since the 1.6 tag is in this release:

- **Steam store — downloads fixed**: login-race guard (`9f6197e`) + BouncyCastle SHA-1 provider
  registration (`63e4366`). ⚠️ download-only; raw `wine exe` launch still has no steam-emu (DRM games
  may not run — see `docs/STEAM_PLUVIA_PORT_PLAN.md`).
- **Components installer (new)**: in-container Wine-dependency installer (Phase 2 file-drop + Phase 3b
  execute engine), copy_dll glob + arch-targeting fixes, win7/winXP set_windows, persisted Installed
  status.
- **On-screen controls**: overlay-opacity slider moved to in-game side menu, live, true 0–100 %.
- **FPS overlay**: tap to toggle orientation, live D3D API label (VKD3D vs DXVK).
- **Vulkan**: Advanced Vulkan / Graphics Driver dialogs scrollable.
- **Video**: full ffmpeg-8 libs bundled for winedmo.

⚠️ DEVICE-TEST status: Steam download fix, Components installer, and overlay-opacity were CI-green but
device-test was still pending/partial at release time.

## 2026-06-24 (late 2) — Steam download fixes + Pluvia/GameNative Steam-store recon & plan

**Steam download bug (✅ MERGED to main `63e4366`/`9f6197e`; compile CI `28139917719` ✅ green;
device-test pending).** User's Steam game downloads failed "Download failed: Unknown error".
Two distinct bugs found from the on-device `steam_debug.txt`:
1. *Login race* — `runInstall` started while `connected=true` but `loggedIn=false` (Steam CM
   connections cycle; re-logon after reconnect is async, license cache masked it). Manifest job
   timed out → `CancellationException`. Fix = new `SteamRepository.ensureLoggedIn(timeoutMs)` guard
   in `runInstall` (re-logon from saved token, wait up to 15s).
2. *SHA-1/BC* (the real download-killer, seen after re-login) — JavaSteam `DepotManifest.serialize`
   calls `MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-1","BC")`; Android's built-in "BC" provider has SHA-1
   stripped → `NoSuchAlgorithmException`. App bundled `bcprov-jdk15on` but never registered it.
   Fix = static initializer in `SteamRepository` that removes stock BC + installs the full
   `BouncyCastleProvider`. Device-test of FlatOut 2 pending; then merge to main.

**Recon + plan: "Pluvia Steam" to replace the current Steam store.** Researched GameNative
(utkarshdalal/GameNative, GPL-3.0; local at `/home/claude-user/GameNative/`) and Pluvia
(oxters168/Pluvia, original, stalled). Key finding: **REF4IK/winlator-ref4ik-** (`com.winlator.cmod`)
already ported the GameNative/Pluvia Steam module into a Winlator **Cmod** fork — same lineage as
us — on the **same `in.dragonbra:javasteam:1.8.0`** we ship. It's an *upgrade*, not greenfield:
our download already works (post-fix); the real prize is the **Goldberg/coldclient launch model**
(ref4ik `SteamGameLauncher.kt`) — our store launches raw `wine exe`, so DRM/steam_api titles fail.
Recommendation = **Option A incremental** (Phase 1: Goldberg launch + loader assets +
`game_source`/`app_id` shortcut extras; then preferred-container, PICS LaunchInfo exe detection,
optional cloud-saves/updates). Full file-level seam map + risks (GPL-3.0, Goldberg asset arch,

## 2026-06-24 (late) — Merged the day's branches to main + new Components installer fix

Rolled the day's feature branches onto `main` (linear rebase/ff, branches deleted). `main` tip now
`0ea1a84`. The 10 commits that make up today (oldest→newest):

1. `445f963` Components Phase 3b — execute engine for installer-based components (.NET/vcredist)
2. `1955f43` Components Phase 3b — auto-close installer sessions + cleanup
3. `c4399ce` Components — install win7/winXP via pure `set_windows` instead of N/A
4. `ce6561d` imagefs — bundle full ffmpeg-8 libs for winedmo video decode *(was the leftover "PENDING #2")*
5. `fe8e74d` HUD — live D3D API label (VKD3D vs DXVK) + tap overlay to toggle FPS orientation
6. `19ec967` HUD — tap overlay to toggle orientation live; dropped the settings dropdown
7. `de71493` Vulkan — make Advanced Vulkan / Graphics Driver dialogs scrollable
8. `16dc463` docs — components N/A backfill + quartz device-test (this log)
9. `4b9b0ad` Controls — overlay-opacity slider moved into in-game side menu (live, true 0–100 %)
10. `0ea1a84` **Components fix (new today)** — see below

**`0ea1a84` Components installer — two bugs fixed** (branch `fix/components-copy-and-installed-persist`,
rebased+ff to main, deleted; CI `28137352729` ✅ green; **device-untested**):
- **`copy_dll` glob was broken.** `copyMatching` built its regex as
  `Regex.escape(pattern).replace("\\*",".*")`, but Kotlin's `Regex.escape` uses `Pattern.quote`
  (`\Q…\E`), so a literal `"*"` file_name pattern compiled to `^\Q*\E$` — matching a file *named* `*`
  (nothing). The `*` components (`atmlib`/`devenum` + the pre-baked win7-SP1 set) set their DLL
  override but **never copied the DLL**. Fix: `pattern.split("*").joinToString(".*"){Regex.escape(it)}`
  → proper glob semantics. (`ComponentInstaller.kt`)
- **"Installed" status didn't persist.** It lived in an in-memory `remember{}` set, so it reset on
  every sheet close/reopen. Now persisted per container in SharedPreferences `component_installs`
  (key `c<id>`): loaded on open, written on each successful install. (`ComponentsSheet.kt`)

**Main artifact build:** triggered run **`28138274652`** (CI Build, artifacts only, `main`).
**Next:** device-test the glob fix + persisted-installed status (root bridge) → then cut 1.6.

## 2026-06-24 — Components: backfilled 15 "N/A" components + device-tested registration

**Backfill (winlator-contents `1f6eb72`).** The catalog had **17 components stuck at N/A**
(`needs-upstream`/`pending-manual`) because their source files were never mirrored. User supplied
the missing Microsoft files (`windows6.1-kb976932` Win7-SP1 x64+x86, ~1.5 GB; `powershell-wrapper.zip`),
covering **15 of 17**.

- The app has **no runtime cab engine** (verified: `ComponentInstaller`/`ComponentExecInstaller`
  handle neither `cab_extract`/`get_from_cab` nor `register_dll`; Phase 3b = installer-exec, not cab).
  The 12 already-working cab components were **pre-baked build-side** — so I followed the same method.
- **Pre-baked** the DLLs with `cabextract` straight out of the SP1 packages (all validated PE/`MZ`),
  packaged each as `<name>__libs.tar.xz` (`win32/`+`win64/` layout, gdiplus = 1.1.7601.17514),
  uploaded all **15** to release `system-libraries-v1` (~10 MB total — not the 1.5 GB raw `.exe`s,
  which would never install).
- **Rewrote** each component in `components.json` to the proven file-drop pattern
  (`archive_extract` + `copy_dll`(+`override_dll`)) — exactly like `devenum`/`riched20`; dropped the
  unsupported `register_dll` (native override inherits Wine's builtin COM registration). PowerShell
  repackaged into the same convention (its `powershell_core` dep was already `ready`).
- Catalog tally now **ready 112 / N/A 2**. Still N/A: `art2k7min` (needs AccessRuntime2007.exe),
  `vbrun6` (needs VB6 SP6 runtime).
- **No app rebuild needed:** `ComponentCatalog` fetches the catalog live (no cache) from
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/components.json`; installed builds see the 15 within minutes.

**Device test — quartz registration CONFIRMED (root bridge, `com.winlator.banner`).** Premise held:
every container prefix already has builtin Wine quartz fully COM-registered (**48** `quartz.dll`
InprocServer32 refs, FilterGraph CLSID `{e436ebb3-…}` + DirectShow Filters category present). Did a
reversible end-to-end install on `xuser-2` "P11 ARM" (backups `*.bak-comp`): native MS `quartz.dll`
→ system32 (1,572,352 B) + syswow64 (1,328,128 B), both `MZ`; inserted `"quartz"="native,builtin"`;
**48 CLSIDs still resolve to quartz.dll (now the native DLL), FilterGraph CLSID intact**. Only the
runtime-load under Wine/arm64ec (launch a DirectShow/FMV title) is left for a user-side check.

## 2026-06-24 — In-game overlay-opacity (controls) reworked + moved to side menu

On-screen controls "overlay opacity not working" → fixed + relocated. Was: draw curve
`0.5+0.7*opacity` (dead top ~29 %, never faint), `setOverlayOpacity()` never `invalidate()`d, editor
hardcoded 0.6. Now **linear 0–100 %** (0 % = fully invisible; accent-stroke alpha floors scaled with
opacity), live `invalidate()`, and the slider **moved from the Input-Controls profile screen into the
in-game side menu (Controls tab)** so it tunes the visible overlay live (`XServerDrawerState`
`overlayOpacity` + `onOverlayOpacityChange`; activity applies + persists). DEFAULT 0.4→0.75 (matches
old look under the new mapping). Branch `feat/ingame-overlay-opacity` `d3f2a8b`, compile CI
`28135045851` ✅ green. Next: device-test → merge for the next release.

## 2026-06-23 — Components installer: catalog + mirror DONE (app side next)

Building a **Components installer** for container settings — browse + install Wine dependencies
(mono, gecko, dotnet, vcredist, d3dx, …) into a container's prefix, the same set BannerHub/GameHub
offer (Bottles "Type 6 — System Libraries", 114 components).

- **Mirrored** all components' binaries to a new release **`system-libraries-v1`** on
  `The412Banner/winlator-contents` — **92 assets**, deduped by URL (shared payloads like the Win7-SP1
  packages referenced once, not per-component). Each asset named after its component.
- **6 not mirrored** (manual re-source list at `/sdcard/Download/winlator-components-needed.txt`):
  the 3 huge **Win7-SP1 platform-update** packages (shared by 14 components → referenced upstream) and
  3 dead/timed-out sources (`art2k7min`, `powershell`, `vbrun6`).
- **`components.json` committed + live** on winlator-contents
  (`raw.githubusercontent.com/The412Banner/winlator-contents/main/components.json`) — 114 components
  with full **Bottles-format install steps**, URLs rewritten to the mirror; `status` per component:
  **ready 97 / needs-upstream 14 / pending-manual 3**.
- **App side: Phase 2 + Phase 3a DONE & MERGED to main** (`4c732b8`, build `28072511822`).
  - **Phase 2** (`91ca6a3`): a "Components" browser in the Win Components tab (`ComponentsSheet`) +
    `ComponentCatalog` (reads the live components.json) + `ComponentInstaller` (file-drop Bottles
    steps → `system32`/`syswow64` + DLL overrides via `WineRegistryEditor`). **Device + root-verified:**
    installed `d3dcompiler_43`/`_47` — correct 64-bit→system32 / 32-bit→syswow64 + overrides set.
  - **Copy hardening** (`4c732b8`): `copy_dll` constrains source to the matching arch sub-tree.
  - **Phase 3a (pre-bake, no app change):** extracted the cab contents build-side with `cabextract`,
    hosted 12 components as `<name>__libs.tar.xz` on the `system-libraries-v1` release, and rewrote
    their catalog steps to file-drop. **22 components now installable** (10 file-drop + 12 pre-baked
    cab: d3dcompiler_42/46, xinput, xaudio2.7, msxml6, atmlib, riched20, vcredist6, winhttp, …).
  - The app reads components.json at runtime, so catalog updates are live without an app rebuild.
- **Still to do — Phase 3b:** the execute engine (`install_exe`/`install_msi` via launching the
  container session) for the +54 .NET / vcredist runtimes. Plan in memory `project_bannerlator_components_installer`.

## 1.6 RELEASE MANIFEST (in progress, since tag `1.5` / `dc74f67`) — NOT yet released

Everything queued for the next release:

**Merged to `main`** (device-confirmed):
1. On-screen dpad/stick multi-touch freeze fix (`fba6080`, merged `d1356d8`) — GitHub issue #5, reporter-confirmed.
2. In-app File Manager batch (`d086990`→`5521e0f`, +`ca26466`) — data-loss paste, silent Run, working dir, off-thread listing, copy-into-self guard, copy progress bar, PTR/scroll/file+exe icons, system-Back-up-one-dir, Run-executes-exe-in-container (`core/WinePath.kt`).
3. Per-game (shortcut) overrides for Renderer + Frame-Gen engine + FPS limiter (`08878be`).
4. Frame gen starts OFF in-game on every launch (`a669b8b`).

5. Standalone FPS limiter — guest-side X11 Present IdleNotify pacing (`bd990b2`) + lsfg≥2 guard (`4909549`); caps fps with Off / bionic-fg / lsfg-vk, both host renderers, live. ✅ merged to main (`a2ebd35`), GameNative credit (`0eadf16`).
6. Advanced Vulkan present settings now actually apply (native/presentMode/filter/swapRB) + renderer-dropdown label/gear fix. ✅ merged to main (`dcd9d47`).

**In progress (before 1.6, user's call)** — branch `feat/layer-download-menu`:
7. Compatibility-layer download menu rework — adrenotools-style cards, cloud opens the sheet directly, install-from-file in the sheet, Wine/Proton chips, in-use marker, byte-accurate install bar. See the dated section below.

Next: finish the download menu → merge → cut 1.6 (bump versionCode from 23 + splash).

---

## 2026-06-23 — Compatibility-layer download menu rework (branch `feat/layer-download-menu`, in progress)

Reworked the per-component download entry points into an adrenotools-style menu. The backend
(`ContentDownloadSheet` + `ContentsManager` + one remote `contents.json`) already covered all five
layers — the work is front-end consolidation + a real install bar. Confirmed design (HTML preview
first, then implemented):

- **Cloud icons replace the gears** on every layer (Wine/Proton, DXVK, VKD3D, Box64/WOWBox64, FEXCore);
  the cloud opens the download sheet **directly**. "Install from file" moved **into** the sheet header.
- **Adrenotools-style rows** — flat rows, `Memory` icon, name + "In use"/"Installed"/desc subtitle,
  trailing `CloudDownload`; chips restyled to the adrenotools `SourceChip` look. **Wine/Proton chips**
  split the compatibility-layer sheet; the others are single-type.
- **In-use marker** for the container's current version (Wine/Box64/FEXCore). Author/size are NOT in
  the manifest (`ContentProfile` has only type/verName/verCode/desc) — would need a manifest extension
  or a HEAD request; deferred.
- **Two determinate 0→100 bars** — blue "Downloading" (byte-accurate) and green "Installing", now also
  **byte-accurate**: `TarCompressorUtils` got a `CountingInputStream` + `OnReadProgressListener` and an
  `extract(…, total, listener)` overload reporting `bytesRead/total` off the compressed stream
  (single-pass, denominator = downloaded .wcp size); `ContentsManager.extraContentFile` got a matching
  overload; the sheet feeds it monotonically (ignoring the brief XZ-probe before the ZSTD pass).

VEGAS and the adrenotools GPU-driver downloader are left untouched. Kept as a centered `Dialog` for now
(bottom-sheet vs centered to be decided on device). First impl device-tested ("looks good").

**Build status (2026-06-23):** UI restyle + cloud-direct + file-in-sheet + in-use = `f4e551e` (CI
`28056314348` ✅). Byte-accurate install bar = `f9485ef` (CI **`28057297317`** — final combined build).
**⏸️ Resume:** verify `28057297317` green → download standard APK → device-test (cloud opens sheet
directly, adrenotools cards, Wine/Proton chips, install-from-file, in-use marker, real install bar) →
decide bottom-sheet vs centered + whether to add author/size → merge to main → cut 1.6.

## 2026-06-23 — Standalone FPS limiter (guest-side IdleNotify pacing) DEVICE-CONFIRMED ✅

Commit `bd990b2`, branch `feat/standalone-fps-limiter`, CI `28043133606` ✅ green.

The reworked limiter — guest-side X11 Present `IdleNotify` pacing in `PresentExtension`
(GameNative/Ludashi-3.1 mechanism: delay IdleNotify → DXVK blocks waiting for a free
buffer → the GUEST throttles), decoupled from the frame-gen layers — **caps fps in all
three FG modes: Off / bionic-fg / lsfg-vk.** Engine-agnostic, all-API, live in-game toggle.
This succeeds where the earlier host-side nanosleep pacer (`f8d7598`) failed (that one only
dropped frames at the compositor; the guest ran full-speed).

**✅ Confirmed on BOTH host renderers** — all 3 modes (Off / bionic-fg / lsfg-vk) cap fps on
the OpenGL host renderer AND the Vulkan host renderer.

**lsfg-mult≥2 guard wired (commit `4909549`, CI `28046025979`).** `lsfgGovernsFps()` returns true
when engine=lsfg + FG enabled + multiplier≥2; `applyFpsLimit()` clamps to 0 in that case, and
`reapplyFpsLimit()` runs from the lsfg branch of `onBionicFgConfigChange` so the guard engages the
moment the multiplier crosses 2. Rationale: lsfg paces itself when multiplying — layering our
IdleNotify limiter on top double-paces the stream (clamps the panel to the limiter value, kills the
FG gain, wastes GPU). Unaffected: bionic-fg, Off, and lsfg at 1× still cap.
> ⚠️ **SUPPORT NOTE:** if users report "the FPS limiter doesn't work / no cap" on **lsfg-vk**, this
> guard is the intended cause — the limiter is deliberately disabled while lsfg-vk multiplies
> (mult≥2). Documented in-code at `lsfgGovernsFps()`. Not a bug.

Remaining: guard CI green → merge `feat/standalone-fps-limiter` → main for 1.6.

## 2026-06-22 — lsfg-vk live reload CONFIRMED ✅ + Off→passthrough fix + engine badge + Task-Manager-on-Vulkan bug (diagnosing)

Session driven by live device questions ("which FG engine is running right now?").

**1. lsfg-vk 3× + LIVE RELOAD confirmed working (supersedes the 2026-06-21 "no live reload" finding).**
Probed the running game (`DOOMBLADE.exe`) on device: `liblsfg-vk.so` mapped into the game proc, env
`ENABLE_LSFG=1` / `LSFG_PROCESS=bannerlator-lsfg` / `LSFG_CONFIG=…/home/xuser/.config/lsfg-vk/conf.toml`,
`Lossless.dll` present. Logcat showed `lsfg-vk: Rereading configuration, as it is no longer valid.` →
`Reloaded configuration … Multiplier: 3` → `lsfg-vk-framegen: Entering Device::Device` — i.e. the
mtime-watch → OUT_OF_DATE → swapchain-recreate reload mechanism (GameNative fork `.so`) DOES fire on our
DXVK→vkd3d→wrapper_icd→Turnip stack now. Panel present rate ~138–143 fps on a 144 Hz panel = base ~46 × 3.
DXVK HUD correctly shows the BASE rate (~46) because lsfg-vk inserts frames downstream of DXVK's counter
(HUD≠panel is expected, and is itself proof FG works). Two conf.toml files exist: live
`home/xuser/.config/lsfg-vk/conf.toml` (read by the layer) and a stale `home/xuser-1/.config/bionic-fg/conf.toml`
(ignored by lsfg; its `fps_limit` field isn't an lsfg option). Minor cleanup candidate.

**2. Off-bug found + fixed.** Installed APK (`7f7ffb5`) predated the Off fix (`80e238a`), so in-game "Off"
wrote `multiplier = 2` (`Math.max(2,0)`) → still 2× frame gen. `80e238a` writes `1` (true passthrough).
Built off-fix APK (run `27941385132`, label `1.3-lsfg-offfix`, ✅ green). PROVEN on device by live-editing
the running conf.toml `multiplier 2→1`: reload fired (`Rereading` → `Multiplier: 1`), FPS dropped to native
~21–27. So `multiplier=1` = genuine off.

**3. Engine badge in in-game FG drawer (commit `740e779`).** Per user, replaced the standalone
"Frame Generation (AI)" header with a title + engine badge row — `Frame Generation  [● bionic-fg]` (green
dot = layer running this session; swaps to `lsfg-vk`; "Off" when disabled). No double labeling (user picked
the "Engine badge" layout). Plumbed `XServerDrawerState.frameGenEngine` ← `container.getFrameGenEngine()`,
wired in `XServerDisplayActivity` next to the other FG drawer-state setters.

**4. Task Manager reports nothing on the Vulkan host renderer (SAME container works on OpenGL). Diagnosing.**
Game runs fine; `winhandler.exe` (the process-list backend) is alive; no app crash. The new off-fix build's
Task Manager refreshes on a render-independent 1s timer and STILL shows empty on Vulkan → ruled out the
UI-tick/copyArea theory. `setupTmCallbacks`/listener registration are NOT renderer-conditional in source, so
nothing intends to disable it on Vulkan. Added WinHandler diagnostic logging (commit `e75d1d4`, tag
`WinHandlerTM`): logs INIT handshake, each `listProcesses` send + sendPacket result, every received request
code, and `GET_PROCESS` replies. One Vulkan run with Task Manager open will split it: `GET_PROCESS` arriving
but UI empty → Compose/StateFlow update problem on Vulkan; no `recv` at all → guest not replying / INIT never
happened. NOT yet root-caused.

**Builds:** off-fix `27941385132` (`1.3-lsfg-offfix`) ✅; logging-only `27943043968` (`1.3-tmlog`) ✅;
combined `27943884565` (`1.3-tmlog-badge` = off-fix + WinHandler logging + engine badge) — in progress.
Branch `feature/lsfg-vk-engine` tip `740e779`, pushed, NOT merged.
**NEXT:** deliver combined APK to `/sdcard/Download` + arm `WinHandlerTM` logcat → user opens Task Manager on
Vulkan once → read logs to root-cause → fix → merge to main.

## 2026-06-21 (night) — lsfg-vk DEVICE TEST: works (2×) but live in-game reload does NOT on our stack ⏸️ RESUME

Installed the test APK (`Bannerlator-1.3-lsfg-vk-standard.apk`, testkey, updates over current), imported a
`Lossless.dll`, selected lsfg-vk in a container, launched DOOMBLADE.

- ✅ **lsfg-vk loads + runs on our Turnip/Proton stack** (GameNative fork `.so` `93fa20bb`). Log
  `/sdcard/Download/lsfgvk_ingame_test.txt`: `Loaded configuration for bannerlator-lsfg` / `Shaders extracted` /
  layers init / AHB + swapchain contexts. **2× frame gen confirmed** (DXVK 39.4 → overlay 78). Opt-in
  `ENABLE_LSFG` gate, conf.toml driving, and `LSFG_PROCESS=bannerlator-lsfg` all work.
- 🐞 **Bug found + fixed (commit `80e238a`):** the in-game "Off" = drawer multiplier 0 (frame-gen stays
  enabled), and the callback did `Math.max(2,0)=2` → forced 2× on Off. Fixed to `mult>=2 ? mult : 1`
  (passthrough). Only matters on relaunch though, because…
- ❌ **Live conf.toml reload does NOT fire on our stack (definitive).** Bypassed the app entirely: `sed`'d the
  running game's conf.toml to `multiplier=1`, confirmed mtime changed → **zero `Rereading configuration` lines,
  FPS stayed 2×** (capture fresh through 19:36, not a gap). Then a fullscreen toggle (swapchain recreate) →
  still no change. So GameNative's mechanism (layer returns `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR` on conf change → DXVK
  recreates swapchain → layer re-reads) is **not propagating through DXVK → vkd3d → wrapper_icd → Turnip**.

**Decision pending (A vs B):**
- **(A, recommended)** ship lsfg-vk as **launch-time** config: restore the per-container Multiplier + Flow
  control (was in `1997a55`, removed in `7f7ffb5`); in-game drawer hides/labels lsfg FG controls as
  "relaunch to apply"; bionic-fg keeps its working live in-game control.
- **(B)** deep-dive why OUT_OF_DATE doesn't recreate/reload here (instrument a debug layer; uncertain).

**Resume state:** branch `feature/lsfg-vk-engine` @ `80e238a` (pushed, NOT merged). Build works; engine
selector + gray-out + DLL picker + lsfg-vk 2× all functional. Only the lsfg live in-game tuning is the gap.

## 2026-06-21 (evening) — lsfg-vk as a SECOND, selectable frame-gen engine (recon → spike → integration → in-game live)

New feature on branch **`feature/lsfg-vk-engine`** (off `main`; NOT merged): add **lsfg-vk** (Lossless
Scaling FG, PancakeTAS lineage) alongside the existing **bionic-fg** so users pick the engine per
container. User supplies their own `Lossless.dll` (we bundle nothing proprietary).

**Recon (3-repo lineage):** lsfg-vk source = `FrankBarretta/lsfg-vk-android@b55b182` (Android AHB port);
built by `The412Banner/LLS` CI (NDK 27, `-DLSFGVK_ANDROID_WINE=ON`, 2-line color-fix patch). Ludashi-plus
itself has NO lsfg-vk (it dropped the feature). LLS run `25313482636` has a clean prebuilt artifact (NO
`libc++_shared` dep — the libc++ blocker was only the old dead APK `.so`).

**Device spike (✅ SUCCESS):** staged the LLS prebuilt `.so` + manifest + the user's `Lossless.dll` into a
container's imagefs, env `LSFG_LEGACY=1 LSFG_DLL_PATH=… LSFG_MULTIPLIER=2 BIONIC_FG_DISABLE=1`. After fixing
my guest-relative DLL path → full Android path (guest is NOT chrooted), **DOOMBLADE ran with lsfg-vk doing
2× frame gen** (DXVK 39.3 → overlay 79). DEFINITIVELY confirmed lsfg-vk (not bionic) via live `/proc/*/maps`:
`liblsfg-vk.so` mapped r-xp in the game procs, `libbionic_fg.so` mapped in zero. lsfg-vk = plain implicit
layer, NO wrapper-ICD hack needed (unlike bionic-fg). ⚠️ it HARD-EXITS (bricks the container) if it can't read
the DLL → the feature must gate on a valid DLL.

**In-game LIVE control (GameNative recon):** stock lsfg-vk reads config once. GameNative makes mult/flow apply
mid-game by rewriting `conf.toml` → their **forked layer** watches the file mtime in its present hook → returns
`VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR` → game recreates swapchain → layer re-reads config (the ~100ms "pause" the user sees
= that rebuild). NO SIGSTOP, no app-side swapchain call. So we **re-vendored GameNative's fork** (`.so` md5
`93fa20bb`, has the `Rereading configuration` mtime-watch) and drive via **conf.toml**, not `LSFG_LEGACY` env.

**Integration (commits `a8974d9`,`1b96cb4`,`1997a55`,`7f7ffb5`):**
- Layer staged opt-in: `assets/lsfg-vk/{liblsfg-vk.so,manifest}` + `ImageFsInstaller.installLsfgVkLayer()`;
  added `enable_environment ENABLE_LSFG=1` to the manifest so the on-by-default upstream layer can't brick
  other containers (loads only when a container selects lsfg-vk).
- Launch wiring (`XServerDisplayActivity`): engine==lsfg → `ENABLE_LSFG=1` + `LSFG_CONFIG=<home>/.config/lsfg-vk/conf.toml`
  + `LSFG_PROCESS=bannerlator-lsfg` + `writeLsfgConfig()` ([global].dll + [[game]] mult/flow/present=fifo),
  gated on the imported DLL existing; else bionic-fg path unchanged. Mutual exclusion = one engine's enable env.
- Data model (`Container`): `getFrameGenEngine/setFrameGenEngine/isLsfgEngine` ("off"/"bionic"/"lsfg"; default
  migrates legacy `frameGenEnabled`).
- UI: container FG control = engine selector ONLY (Off/bionic-fg/lsfg-vk); **lsfg-vk grayed out until a
  `Lossless.dll` is imported** (`LabeledDropdown` gained `disabledOptions`). DLL picker at the bottom of
  Settings (SAF → **copies into `filesDir/lsfg-vk/Lossless.dll`**, loads from the copy).
- **Unified in-game control:** the single in-game multiplier toggle + flow slider drive WHICHEVER engine the
  container runs — `onBionicFgConfigChange` branches to `writeLsfgConfig` for lsfg (live reload via the fork's
  mtime-watch); drawer activated for lsfg containers. No per-container mult/flow control.

**APK signing:** all builds now signed with the AOSP **testkey v1+v2+v3** (`keystore/testkey.p12`, commit
`e09ac71`) so releases/updates install over previous installs (one-time uninstall on first testkey build).

**Build:** test APK run `27920491173` @ `7f7ffb5` (label `lsfg-vk-ui-test3`) IN PROGRESS. ⚠️ Dispatch-race
gotcha hit again — verify `git ls-remote` tip == local before `gh workflow run`. **STILL UNVERIFIED ON DEVICE:**
GameNative fork `.so` loading on our Turnip stack + the live conf.toml reload mid-game (the test APK verifies).

## 2026-06-21 (later) — sticky sync-failure force-disable fix + new `.so` `9136405c` STAGED/SWAPPED

Found (via Jason's PR #6 `layer.cpp:1093` follow-up) that the runtime auto-disable wasn't sticky:
`noteFenceTimeout` stored the kill in `conf.enabled`, which the hot-reload path overwrites wholesale
(`st.conf = newConf`) — so any conf.toml touch (notably the in-game flow slider) silently re-armed
framegen on an ICD path already proven sync-incompatible. **Fix:** new sticky `SwapState::framegenForceDisabled`
that hot-reload never clears; QueuePresent gate honours it; clean re-attempt point stays a swapchain
recreate. Fork `The412Banner/bionic-fg`@`bannerlator-android-wrapper-icd-fixes` commit `c861d8c`
(4th unpushed commit ahead of PR remote `ac2f5c0`). App branch `feature/bionic-fg-pr-followups`
`6807e83` (patch regen 597→608L, applies clean).

**Build gotcha logged:** first dispatch (run 27916226393) checked out the STALE tip `56c6735`
(dispatched a beat too fast after push → byte-identical `4b99b2d1`, no change). Re-dispatched
27916284710 on confirmed remote tip `6807e83` → **new `.so` md5 `9136405c`**, `will NOT re-enable`
log string confirmed compiled in. RULE: after `git push`, verify `git ls-remote` tip == local before
`gh workflow run`, or the run may use the old ref.

**Hot-swapped onto device** (no reinstall — pure layer-internal change, no conf/JNI/ABI surface):
`imagefs/usr/lib/libbionic_fg.so` 4b99b2d1→`9136405c` (owner u0_a484, chmod 600); backups `.bak_c8e4`
(shipped) + `.bak_prev` (4b99b2d1). App force-stopped. Staged `/sdcard/Download/libbionic_fg_9136405c.so`.

⚠️ **Test scope:** the sticky-disable only ENGAGES on a sync-incompatible ICD (6 consecutive fence
timeouts). On the known-good Proton 11 + Turnip path framegen never force-disables, so the fix is
logic-verified by code; on-device this run is a **regression check** = confirm 2× still works + flow
slider still hot-reloads cleanly (i.e. my change didn't break the happy path). ⏳ awaiting user launch;
logcat → `/sdcard/Download/bionicfg_sticky_disable_test.txt`.

## 2026-06-21 — PR #6 review-followup `.so` (`4b99b2d1`) DEVICE-CONFIRMED ✅

Hot-swapped the new layer (`libbionic_fg_4b99b2d1.so`, build run 27915620310, fork HEAD `5f4fc03`)
into the installed app's imagefs — **no reinstall** — and tested on device. **All green.**

- **Frame gen 2× confirmed** (game "FOLLOW MY LIGHT", Screenshot_20260621-155950): DXVK base HUD
  **29.9 fps** → Banner overlay **60 fps** = 2.00×. Adreno 750, GPU 58%.
- **FPS-limiter pacing confirmed** (Screenshot_20260621-160008): in-game FPS Limiter "Limit FPS" ON,
  Max FPS = 30 → overlay ≈ **60–63 fps** (cap × mult). The relaxed clamp + new variance-aware
  pacing path work.
- **New container:** ran on **Proton 11.0-5-arm64ec** + Mesa Turnip v26.2.0 + zink (prior proofs
  were on older containers). Layer loads clean: `VK_LAYER_BIONIC_framegen Device created` →
  `SwapchainState provisioned 1280x720` → `FramegenContext ready mult=2 model=0
  graph=model0-full-of-chain`; config hot-reload flow 0.90→1.00 live.
- **CPU-temp HUD fix holds** (79.7 / 86.6 °C real values).
- **No app crash.** No FATAL/SIGSEGV/tombstone for `com.winlator.banner` or `libbionic_fg`. Display
  went `committedState OFF` at 15:59:41 (backgrounded); the ANR storm after 16:01 is
  `com.qti.diagservices` = AYANEO firmware nvkeeper/diag bug, unrelated. The Claude session is what
  died (known device-launch issue).
- **Benign noise (cleanup candidate):** `failed to load layer libVkLayer_LSFGVK_frame_generation.so:
  libc++_shared.so not found` — that's the *old* LSFGVK-named layer in the APK `lib/arm64`, not our
  layer. Our `VK_LAYER_BIONIC_framegen` (imagefs/usr/lib) loads fine. Strip-or-bundle-libc++ before
  the PR push.

Log `/sdcard/Download/bionicfg_pr_followups_test.txt`; `.so` staged `/sdcard/Download/libbionic_fg_4b99b2d1.so`.

**NEXT (now unblocked):** post the 3 drafted replies to Jason (1093/1334/manifest:17) → push fork
`5f4fc03` to PR #6 branch `bannerlator-android-wrapper-icd-fixes` (one clean batch) → build APK from
`feature/bionic-fg-pr-followups` for the app-side niceties (next reinstall). GN #1443 verify deferred.

## 2026-06-20 — 1.3 shipped public + upstream PR review cycle (in progress)

**1.3 released (public).** Repo flipped public (secret-scanned first), `Bannerlator 1.3` release
created (run 27878418873) with all 3 flavors; release notes credit xXJSONDeruloXx with links to
[bionic-fg](https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/bionic-fg) and [PR #6](https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/bionic-fg/pull/6).
README updated to 1.3 (fixed standard package id `com.winlator.banner`, version line, added the
Frame Generation feature section).

**Upstream PR #6 opened and reviewed.** Fork `The412Banner/bionic-fg` branch
`bannerlator-android-wrapper-icd-fixes`. Jason (xXJSONDeruloXx) left 9 inline review comments;
all 9 answered. He's constructive and wants it in with refinements. Work plan (layer fixes land on
the fork branch → update the PR; app-side conf-key changes land on a new Bannerlator branch
`feature/bionic-fg-pr-followups`):

- **A — separate copy vs generated fence-timeout counters.** Real bug he found: the shared counter
  reset on copy-fence success, so generated-frame timeouts could never reach the disable threshold.
  **Done** (fork commit `4c259f8`): split into `copyFenceTimeouts` / `genFenceTimeouts`, each reset
  only on its own fence type.
- **B — timeout rework + split the generated-frame deadline from the sync-incompatibility recovery
  path.** **Done** (fork commit `345e35e`): frame-budget-scaled sync timeout (4× base interval,
  clamped 200 ms–1 s, else 500 ms), disable threshold 2→6, and a separate shorter generated-frame
  cadence deadline (~2× the output interval) that just skips a late frame without counting it as a
  sync failure. A+B compile-validated via CI.
- **C — fps_limit ergonomics:** justify/relax the 10–200 clamp + add an `fps_limit_enabled` bool so
  the value is remembered across toggles. (layer + app) — *todo*
- **D — optional even-pacing** of generated presents to `1s/(base×mult)` behind an opt-in flag,
  off by default. (layer + app) — *todo*
- **E — document** ENABLE+DISABLE precedence in the manifest (disable wins). Trivial. — *todo*

**Device-creation regression (his main concern) — direction changed after his reply.** The JNI/native
path is unchanged (`Device::create()`, owned + destroyed); only the Vulkan-layer path uses
`Device::wrap()` of the app's device. Jason confirmed **GameNative also uses the layer path**, so our
change reaches it too. Arch root cause: standalone mode runs a second VkDevice and hands frames across
it via `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL` transfers, which need a shared queue/timeline; a wrapper ICD bridges
each guest device to Turnip as a separate host context, so that cross-device sync never completes →
hang. Single-device avoids it by running interpolation on the app's own device (intra-device sync).

**Plan:** likely **no flag** — single-device is probably the correct layer default for both stacks.
**Critical next step: verify single-device on GameNative [PR #1443](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative/pull/1443).**
If it's clean there, make single-device the layer default; only add an init-time `single_device`
launch arg (it can't hot-reload — device is created at init) if GN regresses. Fork commits A–B are
held locally and not yet pushed to PR #6; push as one batch after the GN question is settled and our
stack is re-tested.

## 2026-06-20 — bionic-fg FRAME GEN + FPS LIMITER: merged to main, version → 1.3

**FPS-limiter pacing device-confirmed (Phase 4 complete).** The deferred pacer (built into
the bionic-fg Vulkan layer, `.so` md5 `c8e4b188`) ran on device with `fps_limit=30`: base
DXVK frames locked at ~30 while the on-screen overlay stepped 60 → 90 → 122 as the in-game
FG selector went 2× → 3× → 4× (i.e. on-screen = limit × multiplier). Proven on the OpenGL
host renderer (log `bionicfg_fpslimit_test.txt` + 5 screenshots). The pacer sits at the top
of `BionicFG_QueuePresentKHR`, gated `!st.inPresent && fpsLimit>0`, so it throttles only the
app's real frames; generated frames (presented with `inPresent` true) bypass it. Verified the
pacer `.so` is bundled in the shipped APK asset (`assets/bionic-fg/libbionic_fg.so` md5
`c8e4b188`), not hand-staged.

**Merged to main (`ddf46fb`).** Merged `feature/bionic-fg-framegen` (HEAD `f39b96a`) into main.
One conflict in `.github/workflows/build-bionic-fg.yml` (both branches had it) resolved by
keeping the feature branch's version (the one with the patch-apply step). Stale
`BIONIC_FG_UPSTREAM_REPORT.md` working-tree edit reverted (falsely said single-device crashes;
run6 disproved it). Feature branch kept until the upstream PR is cut.

**CI: artifacts build now produces all 3 flavors (`eb30d1b`).** Previous standard-only build was
a workaround for an OOM (exit 143) caused by packaging the ~588MB APKs in parallel.
`build-artifacts.yml` now runs `assembleStandardDebug assembleLudashiDebug assemblePubgDebug
--no-parallel --max-workers=1` with a larger Gradle heap (serialized packaging) and requires
all 3 uploads. Run 27877129792 confirmed green with all 3 artifacts.

**Version relabel → 1.3 (`9ee5cb2`, `90ce00b`).** Fresh-install Android "All files access"
permission screen showed `1.4-marcescene` (the APK `versionName`) under "Bannerlator Bionic".
Fixed: `app/build.gradle` `versionName "1.4-marcescene"→"1.3"`, `versionCode 20→21`; splash
`SplashScreen.kt` "V 1.2"→"V 1.3" (color unchanged — stays grey `0xFFAAAAAA`); about/main
`MainActivity.kt` stray "V 1.0"→"V 1.3". Build run 27877738210 label `1.3` dispatched on main;
standard APK to be delivered to `/sdcard/Download/Bannerlator-1.3-standard.apk`.

## 2026-06-19 — Vulkan/DXVK/vkd3d BLACK-SCREEN FIX (✅ both renderers device-confirmed)

**Symptom:** native Vulkan + DXVK(d3d8-11) + vkd3d(d3d12) rendered BLACK at full FPS on BOTH
host renderers; OpenGL/DirectDraw/D3D7 fine.

**Root cause:** marcescence shipped the native scanout machinery but left the AHB (DRI3 modifier
1255) present path UNWIRED, and the GL renderer had NO AHB->GL (EGLImage) sampling at all
(GPUImage textureId==0 -> black). Confirmed via device logcat (tag "Dri3": modifier 1255 ->
AHB path taken; pixmaps imported fine -> not an import failure).

**Fix (commit `7d5c9f8`, build label "vkfix3" run 27848179202):** ported proven wiring from
GameNative (utkarshdalal/GameNative, local ~/GameNative):
- `renderer/GPUImage.java` + `cpp/winlator/gpu_image.c`: GPUImage(int socketFd) now locks
  (valid getStride + virtualData) and gained EGLImage support (createImageKHR =
  eglGetNativeClientBufferANDROID + eglCreateImageKHR + glEGLImageTargetTexture2DOES). AHB
  allocated BGRA_8888 (matches X depth-32 / GL_BGRA -> correct colors). unlock-before-release.
- `xserver/extensions/DRI3Extension.java`: setDirectScanout(true) + getStride() width.
- `xserver/extensions/PresentExtension.java`: 3-branch present (Vulkan native+scanout=FLIP /
  Vulkan=COPY via onUpdateWindowContentDirect / GL+SHM=copyArea); relaxed depth 24<->32.
- `XServerDisplayActivity.setupUI` + `VulkanRenderer.setInitialNativeMode`: wired the
  previously-dead Vulkan toggles (native / presentMode / filterMode / swapRB).

**Device results (vkfix3):** ✅ OpenGL host renderer (native Vulkan 1432fps + D3D12/vkd3d
1748fps, correct colors). ✅ Vulkan host renderer (native Vulkan 1449fps, correct colors).

APKs delivered: `/sdcard/Download/Bannerlator-vkfix3-standard.apk` (md5 eebfe339…),
`-pubg.apk` (md5 a7c0acb3…).

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — Native Rendering toggle: device-tested + HUD-freeze fix

User tested the previously-untested Native Rendering+ toggle on the Vulkan host renderer
(AIO Graphics Test, native-Vulkan cube). Two findings:

**1. Windowed content stretches/distorts — EXPECTED, not a bug.** With the graphics test in a
*window* (sub-screen), enabling Native Rendering blits the active swapchain straight to the full
device surface, stretched (LUNARG cube visibly squished). Direct scanout (`onUpdateWindowContent`
FLIP branch → `nativeScanoutSetBuffer`) has no aspect-correct dst path for sub-screen windows;
the aspect-preserving letterbox (`ViewTransformation`, `Math.min`-based) only applies on the
copyArea path. ✅ With the test app **maximized to fullscreen**, native rendering renders the cube
correctly proportioned (FPS still climbs 582→743→…). So for real fullscreen games — the actual use
case — native rendering is correct. Windowed-distortion is a known limitation, not release-blocking.

**2. Perf HUD freezes in Native Rendering — FIXED (commit `f724ec2`).** When Native Rendering was
on, the horizontal perf HUD bar (Vulkan|DXVK|CPU|GPU|…|FPS) froze — values stopped updating while
the game kept animating. Root cause: commit `779967a` wired `hudFrameTick` (which drives
`frameRatingHorizontal.update()`, `XServerDisplayActivity.java:1345`) only into
`onUpdateWindowContentDirect` (the COPY present path). Native rendering uses the FLIP/scanout path
(`PresentExtension.java:154` → `VulkanRenderer.onUpdateWindowContent`), which never called it. Fix:
added `if (hudFrameTick != null) hudFrameTick.accept(window.id);` in the scanout-delivered branch
of `onUpdateWindowContent` (`VulkanRenderer.java:495`), mirroring the COPY path — ticks once per
presented game frame in native mode.

**Build:** `build-artifacts.yml` run `27852720105` (artifacts-only, no release, APK label `hudfix`),
triggered off `main` @ `f724ec2`. ⏳ standard APK to be dropped in `/sdcard/Download/` when green;
HUD fix in native mode still ⏳ device-unconfirmed.

**Next:** device-confirm HUD ticks (and shows a sane FPS — native mode pauses X-side rendering) →
then cut a tagged release (pick a real version; vkfix3/hudfix are just build labels). Cleanup:
graphicsDriverConfig has two competing dialog formats writing the same field.

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — New neon gamepad launcher icon (corner-clip fix)

User supplied a new icon (neon gamepad + magenta chevron + white L-bracket + corner stars on
black, white rounded border) — `/storage/emulated/0/Download/ADM/file_…588.jpg`, 1254×1254 — and
reported the previously-installed icon had its **border corners clipped** by the launcher's
round/squircle mask (device screenshot 20260619-194013, drawer): that old icon was **full-bleed**
(art edge-to-edge) so adaptive masks cut the corners.

**Done (commit `19d62f8`, all 15 files = 5 densities × ic_launcher + ic_launcher_round + adaptive
foreground):**
- Legacy `ic_launcher.png` / `ic_launcher_round.png` (mdpi 48 … xxxhdpi 192) = full image, exact.
- Adaptive foreground (mdpi 108 … xxxhdpi 432) = full art fit into the **safe zone** (~66% of
  canvas, centered, transparent pad) so the launcher mask only ever trims the black margin — the
  white border + corner stars stay fully visible under ANY mask shape. Generated with ImageMagick.
- Adaptive background was already `@color/ic_launcher_background` = `#000000` (matches art bg) → no
  change needed; seamless (image black bg blends into adaptive black).
- No per-flavor icon overrides → shared `main/res` applies to all 3 flavors (standard/ludashi/pubg).
- User explicitly chose "full white border visible" over a bigger near-full-bleed (88%) variant.

**Build:** `build-artifacts.yml` run `27853329322` (artifacts-only, label `neonicon`, off `main` @
`19d62f8`). ✅ standard APK delivered `/sdcard/Download/Bannerlator-neonicon-standard.apk` (md5
`13056a0e2845f56ca34b00405abd3afb`). ⏳ icon device-unconfirmed (note: Android caches launcher icons
— reboot / clear launcher cache if old clipped icon persists).

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — 🏁 RELEASE 1.2 + README features/download button

**Released Bannerlator 1.2** (`release.yml`, run `27853787348`): tag `1.2`, marked **Latest**,
non-prerelease, 3 flavor APKs attached. Standard APK → `/sdcard/Download/Bannerlator-1.2-standard.apk`
(md5 `e5d5689ecf4b9b1a91596d70658a752f`). `release.yml` inputs = `release_tag` / `release_title` /
`release_number` / `release_notes` (publishes `make_latest:true`, supersedes 1.1).

1.2 changelog (commits since `1.1` tag): Vulkan/DXVK/vkd3d black-screen fix (`7d5c9f8` + lead-ups
`b7d4f3a`/`c4d252c`), Native Rendering+ toggle wired (`779967a`), HUD-freeze fix on FLIP path
(`f724ec2`), GL-only effects greyed out on Vulkan (`ba06bc3`/`df3a5c7`), DXVK/VKD3D/Vegas version-list
refresh (`00a2544`), new neon icon (`19d62f8`).

**Splash version** bumped `V 1.1` → `V 1.2` (`SplashScreen.kt:164`, commit `a598584`) BEFORE the
release so it shipped in 1.2.

**README** (commits `ae5d9b7` + `18eab3d`): added **✨ Full Features** section (7 grouped categories —
Windows compat / graphics layers / renderers / containers / games+input / UI+overlay / builds; every
item cross-checked against actual code, NO invented features like AI frame-gen which isn't in this
app); bumped Information-table version V 1.0→V 1.2; added a centered shields.io **Download button**
linking to `/releases/latest` + a "Download" entry in the nav row.

**GameNative render-fix credit** (commit `8792f6d`): expanded the README GameNative credit row to
state its rendering pipeline was the **reference used to fix/rewire the render options** (AHB present
path → Vulkan/DXVK/VKD3D on both renderers: GPUImage socket-buffer lock + EGLImage sampling, DRI3
direct-scanout, Present FLIP/COPY branches, Native Rendering+ scanout). Also appended a **Credits**
section to the **1.2 GitHub release notes** (`gh release edit 1.2`) crediting GameNative (utkarshdalal)
for the same, linking back to the README Credits.

**Next:** device-confirm HUD-tick + new icon on 1.2; cleanup graphicsDriverConfig's 2 competing
dialog formats.

## 2026-06-19 (PM) — bionic-fg frame generation: recon + branch `feature/bionic-fg-framegen`

New feature kicked off: integrate [bionic-fg](https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/bionic-fg) (Android/
bionic Vulkan frame-generation layer, LSFG lineage — same engine GameHub ships as `libGameScopeVK.so`)
as **(a)** a per-container option and **(b)** a live in-game side-menu control.

**Author permission GRANTED** (xXJSONDeruloXx). Terms: (1) credit in README, (2) if source goes in
tree do it as a **git submodule** (his preference), (3) feedback/PRs welcome.

**Recon findings:**
- Guest Vulkan goes through a **wrapper ICD** (`wrapper_icd.aarch64.json` + `GALLIUM_DRIVER=zink` +
  `WRAPPER_*` at `XServerDisplayActivity.java:1823–1861`) bridging to the **Android bionic GPU driver**
  via **adrenotools** — exactly the context bionic-fg targets.
- Tree already has frame-gen groundwork: `app/src/main/cpp/lsfg-vk/` (stub CMakeLists, build excluded)
  + root `build-lsfg-android.sh`. bionic-fg = the bionic-targeted sibling.
- **All 3 CI workflows already use `submodules: recursive`** → adding the submodule needs NO CI change.
- In-game drawer (`XServerDrawerState.kt`) uses StateFlow+Runnable; Native Rendering toggle is a
  turnkey template for a Frame-Gen toggle. bionic-fg **hot-reloads its TOML** → in-game live control
  by rewriting the config (multiplier 0=off / 2–4× / model 0-1 / flow_scale).
- ⚠️ **Critical unknown:** does the wrapper expose a `VkSwapchainKHR` for the layer to hook, or does
  it AHB-export with no WSI swapchain? Resolve with a verification spike BEFORE building UI.

**Deliverable this session:** branch `feature/bionic-fg-framegen` created off `main`; full recon +
phased job task list written to **`BIONIC_FG_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md`** (Phase 0 honor-terms → 1 native
build → 2 spike/de-risk → 3 container setting → 4 in-game menu → 5 polish/release/give-back).

**Next on branch:** Phase 0 — add bionic-fg as a submodule under `app/src/main/cpp/bionic-fg` +
README credit; then the Phase 2 verification spike (gate the rest on it).

### ✅ Phase 0 DONE (2026-06-19) — author terms honored
- Added **bionic-fg as a git submodule** at `app/src/main/cpp/bionic-fg` (his preference), pinned at
  `4f71770`; new root `.gitmodules`. CI needs no change (all 3 workflows already `submodules: recursive`).
- **README credit**: added xXJSONDeruloXx / bionic-fg to the Credits table (frame-generation layer,
  in-tree as a submodule with permission) + a "Frame Generation (bionic-fg)" row in the upstream-stack
  table.
- ⚠️ Submodule has **no LICENSE** → carry to Phase 5.2 (ask author before bundling in a release).
- **Next:** Phase 2 verification spike — build `libbionic_fg.so`, hand-wire one container's env +
  `conf.toml`, launch a DXVK game, confirm via logcat whether the layer engages (wrapper exposes a
  `VkSwapchainKHR`?) BEFORE any UI work.

### ✅ Phase 1 DONE (2026-06-19) — native build
- `build-bionic-fg.yml` (standalone, NDK 26.1.10909125 + cmake 3.22.1, arm64-v8a/android-26). Run
  **27854824786 ✅** → artifact `bionic-fg-arm64` (1.65 MB) = `libbionic_fg.so` (ELF aarch64,
  Android 26, NDK r26b — matches our minSdk 26) + `VkLayer_BIONIC_framegen.json`. Workflow also added
  to `main` (dispatch-only/inert) since workflow_dispatch requires the file on the default branch.
- **Manifest insights (sharpen the spike):** layer is **IMPLICIT** (`enable_environment
  BIONIC_FG_ENABLE=1`); `library_path ../../../lib/libbionic_fg.so` → manifest goes in
  `…/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/`, .so in sibling `lib/`. Implicit layers are found via system
  dirs / `VK_ADD_IMPLICIT_LAYER_PATH` (NOT `VK_LAYER_PATH`, which is explicit-only). Hooks
  vkGetInstance/DeviceProcAddr → sits above the ICD.
- **Refined crux:** bionic `.so` CANNOT load in the glibc guest (box64/Wine) → must load **host-side**
  where the wrapper-ICD server runs Turnip via adrenotools. Spike must confirm (1) host loader honors
  the implicit layer, (2) a real `VkSwapchainKHR` exists to hook (vs AHB-export = nothing to
  intercept). Copy GameHub `libGameScopeVK` imagefs placement.
- Artifact staged for device spike: `/sdcard/Download/bionic-fg/{libbionic_fg.so,VkLayer_BIONIC_framegen.json}`.
- **Next:** Phase 2 spike (needs a device launch — log to crash-surviving `/sdcard/Download/*.txt`
  per the device-launch rule; hold the actual launch for the user).

### Phase 2 spike — runbook written + device recon (2026-06-19)
- **`BIONIC_FG_SPIKE_RUNBOOK.md`** written: full device steps (place `.so` in `imagefs/usr/lib`,
  manifest in `implicit_layer.d`, `BIONIC_FG_ENABLE=1` + `VK_LOADER_DEBUG=all` in container Env Vars,
  conf.toml at guest `$HOME/.config/bionic-fg/`, logcat→`/sdcard/Download/bionicfg_spike.txt`) +
  a decision table + cleanup.
- **Device recon (root bridge):** guest uses its **own glibc Khronos loader**
  `imagefs/usr/lib/libvulkan.so.1.4.315` and already loads **glibc** implicit layers — **MangoHud**
  (`VK_LAYER_MANGOHUD_overlay_aarch64`) + `libutil_layer` — from `usr/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/`.
  MangoHud's manifest is structurally identical to bionic-fg's (enable_environment, `../../../lib/…`,
  same proc-addr hooks) → **discovery works**.
- ⚠️ **KEY HYPOTHESIS:** our NDK/**bionic** `libbionic_fg.so` (links libandroid/liblog/Android
  libvulkan) **will not load in the glibc guest loader** → real path is a **glibc aarch64 build**
  (new Phase 1.5), mirroring how MangoHud + GameHub `libGameScopeVK` ship in imagefs. The spike's
  Test A is designed to confirm this fast (expect a `cannot open shared object`/`libandroid` load
  error), then pivot.
- Standard pkg confirmed `com.winlator.banner` (pubg `com.tencent.ig`); both installed.
- **Next (user):** run the spike launch per the runbook; report the log signals.

### Phase 2 spike ARMED on device (2026-06-19) — awaiting user launch
- Test workload = **DOOMBLADE** (user's choice; real DX11/DXVK game) in **container 2 "P10arm"**
  (`imagefs/home/xuser-2`, the ACTIVE container; arm64ec, DXVK 2.4.1+vkd3d, Turnip, FPS HUD on).
- Staged via root bridge: `libbionic_fg.so` → `imagefs/usr/lib/`, `VkLayer_BIONIC_framegen.json` →
  `imagefs/usr/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/`, `conf.toml` (multiplier=2) →
  `imagefs/home/xuser-2/.config/bionic-fg/`. All chown'd back to app uid `u0_a478`.
- Container 2 `.container` env vars **prepended** `BIONIC_FG_ENABLE=1 VK_LOADER_DEBUG=all`
  (backup at `.container.bak_bfg`).
- Logcat capture → `/sdcard/Download/bionicfg_spike.txt`.
- **REVERT if needed:** restore `imagefs/home/xuser-2/.container.bak_bfg`; rm the staged
  `.so`/manifest/`.config/bionic-fg`.
- ⚠️ Expectation: bionic `.so` likely fails to load in glibc guest loader (ABI) → then Phase 1.5
  glibc build. Spike confirms.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `93d0326`, CI run `24569312463`  
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/AppDrawer.kt`  
**Problem:** `onClick = { /* TODO: open help URL or dialog */ }` — tapping does nothing  
**Fix:** Replace the TODO with a Compose `AlertDialog` containing:
- GitHub repo link: https://github.com/The412Banner/star-compose
- Issue tracker link
- A "Close" button
Or alternatively open a URL via `Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url))`.  
**Effort:** 30 min  
**Commit message:** `fix: implement Help and Support dialog`

---

### Job 2 — About Dialog (MISSING CONTENT)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `d18cae6`, CI run `24569669122`  
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/MainActivity.kt` — `AboutDialog()` at bottom of file  
**Problem:** Current dialog is 4 lines of plain text. Missing: app icon/logo, version name, Wine/Box64/FEX versions, credits list.  
**Fix:** Rebuild `AboutDialog()` as a proper Compose `Dialog` (not AlertDialog — needs more space) with:
- App icon (R.mipmap.ic_launcher_foreground)
- App name + version (read from `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME` + `BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE`)
- Powered-by section: Wine, Box64, FEX-Emu, Turnip
- Credits section with contributor names
- Close button  
**Effort:** 45 min  
**Commit message:** `feat: rebuild About dialog with logo, version, credits`

---

### Job 3 — Container Creation Loading Indicator
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `2e5f4a1`, CI run `24570142005`  
**Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainerDetailScreen.kt` — Save button / confirm action
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainerDetailViewModel.kt` — `saveContainer()` or equivalent
**Problem:** When user taps Save on a new container, it creates silently with no progress feedback. On slow devices this looks like a freeze.  
**Fix:**
1. Add `isCreating: StateFlow<Boolean>` to `ContainerDetailViewModel`
2. Set it true before container creation starts, false when done
3. In `ContainerDetailScreen`, show a full-screen semi-transparent overlay with `CircularProgressIndicator` + "Creating container…" text when `isCreating == true`
4. Disable the Save button while creating  
**Effort:** 45 min  
**Commit message:** `feat: add loading overlay during container creation`

---

### Job 4 — Settings Theme Mismatch (Dark Mode Toggle Broken)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `44a4bdb`, CI run `24571445525`  
**Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/theme/AppThemeState.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/theme/ThemePreset.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/theme/Theme.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/MainActivity.kt`
**Problem (two parts):**
1. `SettingsFragment` uses Light XML AppTheme while the rest of the app is dark Compose — mismatched look inside the Settings screen
2. The `dark_mode` SharedPreferences toggle in SettingsFragment has no effect on the Compose UI — `WinlatorTheme` always uses `darkColorScheme()`  
**Fix:**
1. Read `PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this).getBoolean("dark_mode", false)` in `AppThemeState.init()` and store it as `isDarkMode: StateFlow<Boolean>`
2. Add a light variant to each `ThemePreset` (or use Material3 `lightColorScheme()` as the light base)
3. `AppThemeState.colorScheme` flow emits light or dark scheme based on `isDarkMode`
4. Register a `SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener` so toggling dark mode in Settings updates the flow in real time without restart
5. For SettingsFragment XML mismatch: set `android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.DayNight"` on the fragment's parent or override the fragment background to match Compose surface color  
**Effort:** 1.5 hours  
**Commit message:** `fix: wire dark_mode preference to Compose theme + fix Settings appearance`

### Job 5 — Sort Shortcut List
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `00dc6a5`, CI run `24571836336`  
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ShortcutsScreen.kt`  
**Problem:** No sort option — shortcuts always appear in filesystem order  
**Fix:**
1. Add a sort icon button in the top bar or a sort dropdown in the shortcuts screen
2. Sort options: Name A→Z, Name Z→A, Last Played, Container
3. Store selected sort in `ShortcutsViewModel` (persisted to SharedPreferences)
4. Apply sort to the `shortcuts` StateFlow before emitting  
**Effort:** 1 hour  
**Commit message:** `feat: add sort options to shortcuts list`

---

### Job 6 — Import/Export Container
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `8477b65`, CI run `24572308670`  
**Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainersScreen.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainersViewModel.kt`
**Problem:** The old `ContainersFragment` had import/export container options. These are missing from the Compose version.  
**Fix:**
1. Add "Import Container" and "Export Container" options to the container long-press context menu (already has Duplicate/Delete)
2. Check original `ContainersFragment.java` (deleted) — refer to git history if needed, or find the logic in `ContainerManager.java`
3. Export: zip the container directory → write to Downloads or user-picked location via `ActivityResultContracts.CreateDocument`
4. Import: user picks a zip via `ActivityResultContracts.GetContent` → unzip to containers directory → reload list  
**Check ContainerManager.java for existing import/export methods first** — they likely already exist.  
**Effort:** 1.5 hours  
**Commit message:** `feat: add import/export container to containers screen`

---

### Job 7 — Add Shortcut from External Storage
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `546d25e`, CI run `24577265773`  
**Files:** `ShortcutsViewModel.kt`, `ShortcutsScreen.kt`

---

### Job 8 — Shortcut List Layout Toggle (Grid / List)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `546d25e`, CI run `24577265773`  
**Files:** `ShortcutsViewModel.kt`, `ShortcutsScreen.kt`

## 2026-06-28 — NIS device-test checkpoint (feat/deband-nis)

**Status:** Vulkan NIS ✅ device-proven by user ("it works on Vulkan"). OpenGL/GL NIS ⏳ device-test in progress (Adreno runtime-compile risk = the open question).

**NIS sharpness slider (resolved from committed source, this session):**
- CONTINUOUS on BOTH renderers — every value 0–100 is live (GL `XServerDrawer.kt:463` steps=-1 for mode 7; VK `:547` no steps arg). Not notched.
- GL & VK share the SAME NVIDIA `NVScalerUpdateConfig` constants (stock, untuned) → identical strength on both:
  - slider 0 ≈ OFF (max USM strength ~0.03, overshoot limit ±20%)
  - slider 50 = NVIDIA neutral default (1.6, ±50%)
  - slider 75 = our seeded default (~2.16, ±69%)
  - slider 100 = hard max (~2.73, ±87% — halo onset)
- Input is `clamp(sharpness,0,1)`; 100 cannot be exceeded without editing shader constants. Curve is piecewise-linear with one slope kink at 50 (steeper above), plus soft floors ~17 & ~37 at the low end.

**Side-finding (NOT NIS — cleanup candidate, UNFIXED):** CAS/Sharpen slider snapping is inconsistent across renderers.
- OpenGL: Scaling-mode "Sharpen" (mode 6, `glUpscaleSharpness` steps=3) + standalone "Sharpen (CAS)" toggle (`sgsrSharpness` steps=3) → snap to 5 notches {0,25,50,75,100}.
- Vulkan: "Sharpen" mode 6 (`upscaleSharpness` :547) + standalone "CAS" toggle (`casSharpness` :568) → continuous.
- Fix later: add `steps=3` to the two VK sliders, or drop `steps` on the two GL ones (lean continuous-everywhere; GL keeps notches only for the "stop 0 = OFF" guarantee).

**UPDATE 2026-06-28 (later):** ✅ OpenGL NIS DEVICE-PROVEN — user: "it worked like vulkan". Adreno GL shader-compile risk CLEARED. NIS now proven on BOTH renderers, matching looks. (Install: NIS vc32 needed `pm install -r -d` over the bionic-fg vc33 build via root bridge.) NIS feature merge-ready; debanding (other half of branch) may want a quick dark-gradient check before merge.

**RESUME POINT (2026-06-28, user driving home):** Step 1 NIS = DONE, device-proven both renderers. NEXT SESSION = **Step 2: VRR / refresh-rate matching** (full plan in roadmap memory file). Open optional threads to fold in: (a) debanding dark-gradient check + merge `feat/deband-nis` to main; (b) CAS/Sharpen snapping cleanup (GL 5-notch vs VK continuous). Branch tip `cc3361f`, pushed, unmerged.

## 2026-06-28 — AMA bot: fix question form + switch to auto-answer-every-issue

**Context:** User reported a friend submitted a test question but it never got answered — came in with no label, and manually adding `ama-request` after the fact did nothing.

**Root causes found (two):**
1. **Form template broken since day one.** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ask-the-ai.yml` used the singular key `validation:` instead of GitHub's schema key `validations:`. GitHub strict-rejects invalid form templates → the `?template=ask-the-ai.yml` link silently fell back to the BLANK "Create new issue" page (no `Q:` title, "No labels") → submissions carried no `ama-request` → bot never fired. Fixed singular→plural (`62a223e`). Template now parses clean (verified with js-yaml).
2. **After-the-fact labeling is a no-op.** The `labeled` trigger only listens for the `question` label, not `ama-request` — so manually adding `ama-request` later never triggers anything. (Adding `question` does — used it to force-answer the friend's #34.)

**Decision (user chose): drop the fragile form/label dependency entirely → auto-answer EVERY new issue.** GitHub's new mobile issue-creation UI made the form/chooser unreliable across devices, so relying on it was the real friction.

**Workflow change (`035ef08`):**
- Trigger: job now runs on ANY `issues:[opened]` (skips bot-opened + already-`answered`); `labeled`+`question` kept as a maintainer force-rerun on older issues.
- Per-user daily counter rewritten to count `label:answered author:X created:>=dayAgo` with `>=` (new issues no longer carry `ama-request`, so the old counter would never fire).
- Now prepends the issue **Title** to the question (bug reports often put the ask in the title with an empty body).
- Rate limits unchanged: 5/user/day (maintainers exempt) + 200/month.
- Side effect (user accepted): bot now also answers bug reports / feature requests, not just questions.

**Docs (`a394c2b`):** README badge + 3-steps now point to plain `/issues/new` ("Open an issue"); maintainer notes drop the form-only/`ama-request` wording (only `answered`+`question` labels needed now).

**Proven:** plain unlabeled test issue #35 ("Native Rendering+") auto-answered in ~1–2 min with accurate citations (`XServerDisplayActivity.java:1936-2007`, `XServerDrawer.kt:633`) and got `answered`; closed as test. Also confirmed `OPENCODE_AUTH` secret is set and #34 answered correctly. No stale "No answer generated" comments remain on #32–#35.

**Commits:** form fix `62a223e`, workflow `035ef08`, README `a394c2b` — all on `main` via API.

## 2026-06-29 — 2.1 stable cut + GL Native Rendering P0 (scanout extraction)

### ✅ 2.1 STABLE released
Cut `2.1` (versionCode 33, plain tag, `prerelease:false`/`make_latest:true`, releases/latest→2.1). Bumped `app/build.gradle` first (`282a674`) since `release.yml` reads version FROM there. Successful run `28341709108`; 3 APKs + `update.json` vc33 attached. Shipped: **VRR / refresh-rate matching** (Auto match-FPS + manual 60/90/120/144 snap slider, all 3 renderers), **NIS** upscaler (NVScaler mode 7, Vulkan), **debanding** (Vulkan compositor, strength slider), **Task Manager Vulkan/ASR fix**, **install-progress 98%→100% fix**, AIO Graphics Test v1.6.1 bundled.
- ⚠️ **Release-notes trap (recurring):** first dispatch `28341637256` had a literal `"` in the notes → would break `release.yml`'s `NOTES="${{ inputs.release_notes }}"` bash line (the 1.9.2 failure). CANCELLED before the build finished (no tag leaked), re-dispatched with curly-quote-safe notes. **Lesson: pass release notes via a file / no straight `"`.** Final body replaced post-publish via `gh release edit --notes-file` for the clean 2.0-style layout.
- README "What's New in 2.0"→"in 2.1" rewritten + Full Features updated (NIS/deband/VRR) — `d019bc3`. Verified each feature is real in renderer code before writing (deband `setDeband`, NIS NVScaler mode 7, `matchRefreshRate`).

### ▶️ GL Native Rendering — P0 (renderer-neutral scanout extraction) — CI-GREEN, device-test owed
Goal: bring **Native Rendering** (direct scanout via `SurfaceControl`→HWC overlay) to the **OpenGL** renderer (Vulkan-only today). Plan committed `docs/GL_DIRECT_SCANOUT_PLAN.md` (`228319f`). Phased P0–P6.

**P0 (delegated to graphics-vulkan-engineer, branch `feat/p0-scanout-extract`, off main, pushed, NOT merged):** behavior-preserving extraction of the scanout impl into a standalone renderer-neutral `app/src/main/cpp/scanout/ScanoutContext.{h,cpp}` (zero Vulkan/GL/EGL). Methods moved (initScanout→initFromWindow, scanoutSetBuffer→setBuffer, applyScanoutBuffer→applyPendingCursor, dst/cursor setters) + state + SC_CREATE/ST_* macros + 9 dlsym fn ptrs. **Cursor threading split:** ScanoutContext gets pure setters + `applyPendingCursor()`; `needsRender`/`dirtyCV`/`cursorMoved` STAY in VulkanRendererContext, render loop calls `scanout.applyPendingCursor()` at `VulkanRendererContext.cpp:1485`. `VulkanRendererScanout.cpp` → thin forwarders. **`vulkan_jni.cpp` UNCHANGED → libvulkan_renderer ABI preserved.** Dropped 3 dead members; 1 log-only line touched. **CI run `28342956403` GREEN all 3 flavors.** CI-green only — NOT device-proven.

**RESUME POINT / NEXT ACTION (user is about to test):** **P0 GATE = Vulkan-native REGRESSION device test.** Install the `feat/p0-scanout-extract` build (CI `28342956403`, release_number `p0-scanout`), open a **VULKAN** container with **Native Rendering ON**, run a DXVK game (AIO DX11 SPACE scene = known-good). Confirm UNCHANGED vs before: presents correctly, colors right, cursor right (pos/hotspot, not double-drawn), no black screen, clean teardown on rotate/background. **This must pass before P1.** Then P1 = new `libdirect_scanout.so` + `DirectScanout.java` (dormant, no wiring). Project memory: `project_bannerlator_gl_native_rendering.md`.

**UPDATE — P0 device check + dumpsys SurfaceFlinger analysis (2026-06-29):** Tested the `p0-scanout` build on device "Pocket FIT" (Adreno 750 / SD8Gen3, Vulkan|DXVK), AIO DX11 cube test, Native Rendering OFF vs ON.
- **Renders correctly both ways** (colors/geometry/cursor fine, no black screen) → **P0 extraction looks behavior-preserving** (regression-clean; strict A/B vs pre-P0 2.1 Native-ON not run, but the feature works on the refactored build).
- **`dumpsys SurfaceFlinger` (root bridge, game in foreground) CONFIRMS overlay promotion WORKS:** `winlator_game_buf#66438` = **composition type=DEVICE (2)** = HWC hardware overlay (parent `winlator_game#66434` is the empty container SC). Game buffer `1280x702 BGRA_8888`, display controller SCALEs it ~1.5x→1080p **for free**. So direct scanout offloads the GPU from compositing, as intended. (3 layers total on DEVICE overlays; 128 idle/INVALID.)
- **User Q "why is FPS lower with Native ON?"** OFF=766fps/29% GPU/86°C/1.3ms vs ON=584fps/27% GPU/96°C/1.7ms. **Not a failure** — overlay is promoting. Direct scanout couples the guest to a real vsync-paced, triple-buffered overlay queue with buffer-release backpressure → the guest can't sprint ahead; the OFF path lets it race to 766 into Winlator's looser offscreen compositor, but **most of those frames are never displayed**. GPU load staying low = GPU offloaded (the win); CPU temp up = per-frame `ASurfaceTransaction`/fence cost. **Native Rendering is a latency/power feature, not a more-FPS feature**; an uncapped microbench is the worst way to measure it (cap to panel 60/120 and compare power/temp/latency at equal displayed FPS to see the benefit). Same backpressure tradeoff will apply to the GL port at P4.
- **NEXT: merge P0 → start P1** (`libdirect_scanout.so` = `scanout/directscanout_jni.cpp` + `ScanoutContext.cpp`, links log/android/dl/atomic only, NO vulkan; + `DirectScanout.java`; dormant, not wired).

**UPDATE — GL Native Rendering P0 merged, P1 done+merged, P2 in flight (2026-06-29):**
- **P0 MERGED** to main (merge `9575164`, no-ff, branch deleted) — renderer-neutral `ScanoutContext` extraction, Vulkan-native overlay device-confirmed (see above).
- **P1 DONE + CI-green + MERGED** (graphics-vulkan-engineer; CI `28344514069`; merge `51ccb3a`, branch deleted). New **`libdirect_scanout.so`** (CMake target `direct_scanout`: `scanout/directscanout_jni.cpp` + `ScanoutContext.cpp`, links **log/android/dl/atomic only — NO vulkan/adreno**; ScanoutContext.cpp object-duplicated across this + vulkan_renderer, intended). JNI = heap `ScanoutContext*` as jlong, 1:1 forwarders; cursor applied **inline** (GL model, no needsRender/dirtyCV). New **`DirectScanout.java`** — lifted child-SC builder/teardown/`applyScanoutSwapTransform`(R/B-swap)/`releaseScanoutSurfaces` from `VulkanRenderer.java:614-679`/`:168-300`, generalized `enable(SurfaceControl parent,...)` to take parent SC as arg. **VulkanRenderer.java byte-for-byte unchanged; nothing wires DirectScanout yet → behavior-neutral, no device test needed.**
- **P2 IN PROGRESS** (main session, one-liner): `XServerView.getSurfaceControl()` (`:153`) now returns `glSurfaceView.getSurfaceControl()` for GL too (was null; GLSurfaceView extends SurfaceView → inherits it, API29+). Vulkan return unchanged. **Behavior-neutral now** — only callers are `VulkanRenderer.java:173`/`:623` (Vulkan-only path); no GL path calls it until P3, so the "non-null SC on GL" device check lands at P3. Branch `feat/p2-gl-surfacecontrol`, CI run `28345217160` building, NOT merged.
- **NEXT: P2 CI-green → merge → P3** = GLRenderer scanout lifecycle (`nativeMode`/`setNativeMode`/`setInitialNativeMode`, `DirectScanout.enable/disable`, dst + cursor, implement GL `setRenderingEnabled`→`xServer`; toggle wiring §4 activity+drawer). **P3 = first GL device validation** (§3: non-null GL SC + cursor SC composites ABOVE GL content). P4 = per-frame game push (feature lights up). Delegate P3 to graphics-vulkan-engineer.

## 2026-06-29 — Controller bindings persistence + scrollable profiles (#37) MERGED

**✅ DEVICE-PROVEN (Odin 2) + MERGED to main** (merge `d3ee2d5`, no-ff).
- `2f5cf0a` persist controller bindings + harden profile import (issue #37)
- `4867789` make the Download Profiles list scrollable
- Touches: `Binding.java`, `ControlsProfile.java`, `InputControlsScreen.kt`.
- Build: manual "Any branch compilation" run `28365146389` GREEN (all 3 flavors). User device-tested → working.
- No release cut (still 2.1 stable). Branch `fix/odin2-controller-bindings` can be deleted.

## 2026-06-29 — GL Native Rendering P2 MERGED, P3 started

**P2 MERGED** to main (merge `460725f`, no-ff; branch `feat/p2-gl-surfacecontrol` deleted local+remote). One file: `XServerView.getSurfaceControl()` now also returns `glSurfaceView.getSurfaceControl()` (GLSurfaceView extends SurfaceView → inherits it, API29+). Behavior-neutral (only Vulkan path calls it today). CI run `28345217160` was green.

**P3 STARTED** — delegated to graphics-vulkan-engineer. Scope = GLRenderer scanout LIFECYCLE only (no per-frame push, that's P4): `nativeMode`/`setNativeMode`/`setInitialNativeMode`, `DirectScanout.enable/disable`, dst + cursor SCs, implement `setRenderingEnabled`→`xServer`, toggle wiring §4 (activity + drawer). Goal: enabling GL native builds the child SCs + shows cursor SC; game still GL-composited. **P3 = first real GL device validation** (cursor SC composites ABOVE GL content). Plan `docs/GL_DIRECT_SCANOUT_PLAN.md`.

**UPDATE — P3 CI GREEN, device-test owed (2026-06-29):** Branch `feat/p3-gl-scanout-lifecycle` (`f414e38`), CI run `28367896129` GREEN all 3 flavors (build 14m54s). +184 lines / 3 files: `GLRenderer.java` (lifecycle: setNativeMode/setInitialNativeMode/isNativeMode, enableScanout/disableScanout = game SC layer1 + cursor SC layer2 above GL, setRenderingEnabled→xServer, sendCursorToScanout skips GL cursor pass, updateScanoutDst, onSurfaceDestroyed/forceCleanup teardown), `XServerDisplayActivity.java` (toggle wiring in drawer onChange + launch path: setInitialNativeMode from container.isRendererNative() + setSwapRB), `XServerView.java`. NO per-frame push (P4). **NOT merged — P3 is the device gate.** Device-test (GL container, Native ON): cursor SC composites ABOVE GL content (not double-drawn, right pos/hotspot); `dumpsys SurfaceFlinger` shows child game+cursor SCs; rotate/app-switch/exit no leak/black; Native OFF = regression-clean. Merge only after device pass.

**UPDATE — P3 DEVICE-VERIFIED in-game (2026-06-29, device "Pocket FIT" Adreno 750/SD8Gen3, GL|DXVK, AIO DX11 cube):** `dumpsys SurfaceFlinger` (game in fg, Native Rendering ON) confirms the P3 lifecycle BUILT the child SurfaceControls under the GLSurfaceView SC: `winlator_game#3181` + `winlator_game_buf#3185` + `winlator_cursor#3183` + `winlator_cursor_buf#3186`(16x16) all present. **Cursor SC is a separate composited layer** (winlator_cursor_buf, CLIENT, ROT_90, 1064,0-1080,16 = top-right) ABOVE the GL SurfaceView(#3165) → cursor-on-own-SC WORKS, no double-draw. **Game still GL-composited** (the GL SurfaceView carries the full game image; `winlator_game_buf` NOT in the active HWC composited set = game SC is bufferless, no per-frame push) = EXACTLY correct for P3. No overlay promotion of the GAME yet (that's P4). No black screen, renders fine. ✅ **P3 DEVICE GATE PASSED.**

**📌 User finding — "screen effects still work with Native Rendering ON" (screenshot: FXAA+CRT+Toon+NTSC all checked + Native toggle ON + effects visibly applied to the cube):** EXPECTED in P3, NOT a bug. P3 only moves the CURSOR to its own SC; the GAME still flows through the GL renderer → EffectComposer → onDrawFrame, so effects still apply. The "effects can't work with native rendering" end-state only kicks in at **P4** (game frame pushed straight to HWC overlay, bypassing GL entirely) + **P5** (grey-out the effect toggles when native on). So P3 = effects coexist with native; that flips at P4.

**▶️ NEXT: P3 passed device gate → MERGE `feat/p3-gl-scanout-lifecycle` → P4** (per-frame game push = feature lights up + effects-bypass behavior appears).

**UPDATE — P4 CI GREEN, device-test owed (2026-06-29):** Branch `feat/p4-gl-perframe-push` (`d44b560`), CI run `28369663007` GREEN all 3 flavors (artifacts `Bannerlator-p4-gl-perframe-{standard,ludashi,pubg}`). +70 lines, 3 files: **GLRenderer.java** new `presentScanout(Window,Drawable)` (lift of VulkanRenderer.onUpdateWindowContent AHB body: synchronized(content.renderLock), GPUImage g=content.getTexture(), ahbPtr=g.getHardwareBufferPtr(), fence=g.unlock(), scanout.present(ahbPtr,rx,ry,w,h,fence), g.lock(), refreshDataFromTexture(), first-delivery pause via xServer.setRenderingEnabled(false)+xRenderingPausedForScanout, hudFrameTick.accept) + `setHudFrameTick(IntConsumer)`. **PresentExtension.java** GL-native FLIP branch before final else (mirrors Vulkan isNative: content.setTexture(pixmap GPUImage)+setDirectScanout(true)+sendCompleteNotify FLIP+presentScanout+emitIdleNotify). **XServerDisplayActivity.java** glr.setHudFrameTick wired (updates frameRating/frameRatingHorizontal/perfHud on frameRatingWindowId). Reuses DirectScanout.present()/isGameFrameDelivered() from P1. Vulkan/ASR untouched. **NOT merged — P4 is the full-feature device gate.** Device-test (GL container, Native ON, DXVK game): game presents correct (no black, colors right=swapRB, letterbox); `dumpsys SurfaceFlinger` GAME layer on HWC overlay (composition type=DEVICE) GL layer skipped (= the win vs P3 CLIENT/GL); cursor correct not double-drawn; HUD ticks (not frozen); rotate/bg no leak; effects now silently stop applying (expected, P5 greys toggles). Merge after device pass.

**UPDATE — P5 CI GREEN (stacked on P4), device-test owed (2026-06-29):** Branch `feat/p5-gl-effect-exclusion` (`64b7cfb`) OFF `feat/p4-gl-perframe-push` (`d44b560`) — so ONE test build = P4 per-frame push + P5 grey-out. CI run `28373207641` GREEN all 3 flavors (`Bannerlator-...{standard,ludashi,pubg}` — note artifact name prefix per agent). +87 lines, 2 files: **XServerDisplayActivity.java** — `disableNativeRenderingForPreset()` got a GLRenderer arm (setNativeMode(false)); new `resetGlEffectsForNative(GLRenderer)` (Direction B, mirrors resetVulkanPresets: filter→1/setUpscaler(0), remove FSREffect+HDREffect, applyScreenEffects neutral, deband off, reset XServerDialogState flows glUpscalerMode/Sharpness/sgsr*/hdrEnabled/se*/deband* — touches EffectComposer+StateFlows only, never apply callbacks → no re-entry); Native toggle GL arm calls resetGlEffectsForNative on enable; Direction A wired into onGlUpscalerApply(mode≥3)/onSgsrUpdate(enabled||hdr)/onScreenEffectsApply(non-neutral)/GL onDebandApply(enabled) → each calls guarded disableNativeRenderingForPreset(). **XServerDrawer.kt** — GraphicsContent derives `glEnabled = !nativeRenderingEnabled` (existing reactive XServerDrawerState flow, no new flow) + dimmed glHeaderColor; passes glEnabled to UpscalerModeButtons/scaling+SGSR IntSliders/Sharpen(CAS)+HDR ToggleRows/DebandControls/Screen-Effects sliders/SeShaderToggles; added `enabled` param to IntSlider+DebandControls (Vulkan callers default true → unchanged).

**▶️NEXT: device-test the combined P4+P5 build → if pass, merge `feat/p5-gl-effect-exclusion` to main (brings P4+P5 together) → P6 optional cleanup (fold Vulkan/ASR onto DirectScanout).**

**UPDATE — Combined P4+P5 DEVICE-TESTED (2026-06-29, Adreno 750/SD8Gen3, GL|DXVK, AIO DX11 cube). Mixed result → overlay-promotion fix started.**
Driven via root bridge (toggle in-drawer, dumpsys OFF vs ON, drawer open vs closed):
- ✅ **P4 functional:** Native ON builds scanout SCs (winlator_SC_count 0→14): winlator_game/winlator_game_buf (game buffer 1280×702 ROT_90 → disp 0,0,1080,1920 fullscreen), winlator_cursor/winlator_cursor_buf (16×16). Game renders perfectly, colors correct (swapRB good), cursor on own SC. Toast "Native Rendering+ Enabled".
- ✅ **P5 grey-out:** toggling Native ON instantly dims+disables FXAA/CRT/Toon/NTSC + sliders (verified screenshot vs Native-OFF bright state).
- ❌ **THE BUG — no HWC overlay promotion:** Native OFF = GL SurfaceView is `composition type=DEVICE` (single fullscreen overlay, efficient). Native ON (even drawer CLOSED) = winlator_game_buf AND GL SurfaceView both **CLIENT** (GPU). Raw HWC = `composition: DEVICE/CLIENT` = SF requested overlay, HWC REJECTED → GPU fallback. So zero power/latency win; currently WORSE than native-off. Vulkan native promotes to DEVICE on same device/scene/scale → rejection is GL-specific.
- **Diagnosis:** gameSC IS opaque in both (DirectScanout.java:85-86 / VulkanRenderer.java:174-175) — NOT the cause. The game/cursor SCs are CHILDREN of the renderer's own SC (parent = xServerView.getSurfaceControl() = GLSurfaceView's SC). On GL the paused GLSurfaceView keeps its last opaque fullscreen buffer on the parent layer → SF can't drop it → overlay rejected. Classic hole-punch issue. Can't just hide the parent SC (children hide too).
- **▶️FIX STARTED** — branch `feat/gl-scanout-overlay-fix` off `feat/p5-gl-effect-exclusion` (graphics-vulkan-engineer, agentId a1c4b9fd82603ed55): investigate how Vulkan's base surface stays non-competing, then make the GL base layer transparent/hole-punched/bufferless when scanout active so SF can overlay-promote the opaque child game SC. Primary device gate = dumpsys winlator_game_buf = composition type=DEVICE, GL layer skipped.
- ⚠️ Native left toggled ON on the test container.

**UPDATE — GL overlay-promotion fix #1 (idle base layer) CI-GREEN, device-test owed (2026-06-29):** Branch `feat/gl-scanout-overlay-fix` (`b418e53` off P5 `64b7cfb`), CI run `28376490129` GREEN. +38 lines GLRenderer.java only. Fix = once first game frame reaches game SC, onDrawFrame renders ONE cleared frame (glClearColor 0,0,0,0) then early-returns every subsequent frame (no GL compositing of game/cursor); onPointerMove no longer requestRenders in native mode → base GLSurfaceView goes IDLE holding a single cleared buffer (mirrors Vulkan render-loop single clearing frame + ASR bufferless base). `xRenderingPausedForScanout` made volatile (X-thread write / GL-thread read). Theory: idle base lets SF occlusion-cull it so HWC promotes the opaque game SC to DEVICE. **CAVEAT: addresses BLOCKER #1 ONLY (competing base layer). Base still OPAQUE black (agent noted translucent-format fallback lever). Did NOT address BLOCKER #2 (SC-level ROT_90+scale that Adreno overlay pipes may reject) — libwinemu intel arrived after agent committed.** This build isolates hypothesis #1. **DEVICE GATE = dumpsys winlator_game_buf composition type CLIENT→DEVICE.** If DEVICE → #1 was the whole fix (don't touch orientation). If still CLIENT → blocker #2 confirmed → GameHub-style geometry rework (no SC-level rotate/scale, fit via setBuffersGeometry). ⚠️Agent also committed PROGRESS_LOG.md ON the branch (+36) → diverges from main, reconcile on merge.

**UPDATE — overlay-fix #1 (idle base) DEVICE-TESTED 2026-06-29: INSUFFICIENT, blocker #2 CONFIRMED.** GL container + Native ON + drawer closed, dumpsys: winlator_game_buf STILL = CLIENT (raw `composition: DEVICE/CLIENT` = HWC rejected overlay). Game renders fine / no black / no regression — but no DEVICE promotion. Game SC still carries `ROT_90` + source 1280×702 → disp 1080×1920 (rotate + 1.5× scale). So idle-base was necessary-but-not-sufficient. **Blocker #2 = Adreno HWC won't overlay a layer needing SIMULTANEOUS rotation + scaling** (matches libwinemu RE: GameHub does ZERO SC-level geometry, sizes via setBuffersGeometry+RGBA_8888). ▶️Agent a1c4b9fd82603ed55 resumed on same branch `feat/gl-scanout-overlay-fix` to do blocker #2: eliminate SC-level rotate+scale on the game SC (compare why Vulkan native IS overlay-eligible on this device but GL isn't). ⚠️Risky (orientation/fit). Device gate unchanged: winlator_game_buf CLIENT→DEVICE + game still correct.

**NOTE — interpreting "native ON feels different" (2026-06-29, important for the upcoming test):** User observes real latency/FPS difference Native ON vs OFF and asked if the overlay is already working. THREE distinct things change when Native turns on — don't conflate:
- **A. P5 toggles grey out** — pure UI, no perf impact unless an effect was active (confound: turning off an active effect changes FPS).
- **B. GL compositor pass is SKIPPED** — even with zero effects, Native-OFF does a per-frame GPU blit (game texture → GLSurfaceView + swap); Native-ON's `presentScanout` pushes the AHB straight to the game SC and idles the base, removing that GPU stage + changing present pacing (SurfaceControl queue vsync/backpressure). **This is a REAL, PARTIAL win and is what the user is measuring — it happens WHETHER OR NOT the overlay promotes.**
- **C. HWC overlay promotion (`DEVICE`)** — display controller does the final composite, GPU does nothing for it. **STILL NOT happening (dumpsys = CLIENT).** This is the big win blocker #2 targets.
Corrected an earlier overstatement ("pointless/regression"): B is a legitimate benefit on its own; C is the additional win still missing. **To verify C specifically: compare GPU load/power/temp at CAPPED equal FPS (e.g. lock 60) OFF vs ON — only C drops GPU load meaningfully; FPS alone is downstream of B and will differ regardless.** The `dumpsys` DEVICE-vs-CLIENT line is the authoritative overlay readout.

**TEST QUEUED (after blocker-#2 build finishes):** blocker #2 fix is building on `feat/gl-scanout-overlay-fix` (agent a1c4b9fd82603ed55, eliminate SC-level rotate+scale). When green → device-test the full thing: (1) dumpsys winlator_game_buf CLIENT→DEVICE (the gate), (2) game still correct orientation/fit/colors, (3) capped-FPS GPU/power A/B to quantify C, (4) cursor/HUD/lifecycle.

## ⏸️ RESUME-HERE CHECKPOINT (2026-06-29, before user device reboot)

**Active task: GL Native Rendering — overlay-promotion fix.** Session runs on the device → reboot kills it + the background CI watch (CI continues server-side).

**MERGED to main:** P0 (scanout extract) + P1 (libdirect_scanout) + P2 (GL getSurfaceControl) + P3 (GL scanout lifecycle). main tip = `7aaacaf` (docs only after the P3 merge `2fe3f10`).

**NOT merged — all on branch `feat/gl-scanout-overlay-fix` (tip `e036124`):** stacked P4 (`d44b560` per-frame push) → P5 (`64b7cfb` effect/scaling grey-out) → overlay-fix#1 (`b418e53` idle base) → overlay-fix#2 (`e036124` TRANSLUCENT base). ⚠️ Agent also committed PROGRESS_LOG.md ON this branch (+36) → diverges from main's PROGRESS_LOG; reconcile (keep main's) on eventual merge.

**Build in flight:** CI run **`28378890898`** for `e036124` (translucent base) — was BUILDING at checkpoint, status NOT yet confirmed. ON RESUME: `gh run view 28378890898 --json status,conclusion`; if green, artifacts = `Bannerlator-glscanout-overlayfix-{standard,ludashi,pubg}`.

**DEVICE-PROVEN SO FAR (Adreno 750/SD8Gen3, GL|DXVK, AIO DX11 cube):** P4 functional (game flows through scanout, renders correct, swapRB ok, cursor own SC), P5 grey-out works. ❌ Overlay NOT promoting: every Native-ON test shows `winlator_game_buf = CLIENT` (raw `composition: DEVICE/CLIENT` = HWC rejected). fix#1 (idle OPAQUE base) tested INSUFFICIENT. fix#2 (translucent base) = current build, UNTESTED.

**KEY FINDING (agent, code-read):** the game-SC geometry (src 1280×702→dst fullscreen + ROT_90=global display orientation) is BYTE-FOR-BYTE the same as the Vulkan native path, which DOES promote to DEVICE on this device → so rotate+scale is NOT the GL-specific blocker (my earlier blocker-#2 hypothesis likely WRONG). The GL-specific difference = GLSurfaceView base is OPAQUE & composited (CLIENT) even when idle, starving the game overlay's HWC plane. fix#2 makes it TRANSLUCENT so SF can skip it (Vulkan base = idle swapchain, ASR = bufferless — both non-competing).

**NEXT ACTION ON RESUME:** 1) confirm CI `28378890898` green. 2) Device-test translucent build (GL container, Native ON, DX11 scene, drawer closed): **THE GATE = dumpsys `winlator_game_buf` composition type CLIENT→DEVICE** + game still correct (orientation/fit/colors/no-black). 3) If promoted → quantify the win: capped-60 GPU/power/temp A/B (off vs on). 4) If STILL CLIENT → deeper dig: why does identical-geometry Vulkan promote but GL not (plane budget? layer count? the extra activity/decor layers? try fewer layers / check HWC plane caps). 5) If promotes + correct → merge `feat/gl-scanout-overlay-fix` chain to main (reconcile PROGRESS_LOG), then P6 optional. If unfixable → gate GL-native experimental (plan §3 fallback).

**Interpretation reminder (A/B/C):** user feels a real latency/FPS diff Native ON vs OFF = the **B** win (GL compositor pass skipped) which happens regardless of overlay; **C** (the DEVICE overlay) is the missing big win. Verify C via capped-FPS GPU/power, NOT raw FPS. dumpsys DEVICE/CLIENT = authoritative.

**Bridge test recipe (from this session):** `getlog --exec` (PATH +=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin). Graphics tab icon tap (70,138); Native Rendering toggle (765,968); close drawer keyevent 4; dumpsys → `/sdcard/Download/_x.txt`; check `grep -iE "HWC layers" -A18 | grep -iE "winlator_game|SurfaceView\[com.winlator|DEVICE|CLIENT"`; SCcount `grep -icE "winlator_game|winlator_cursor"` (0=native off, ~14=on). Foreground session: `monkey -p com.termux -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1`. ⚠️ Native left toggled ON on test container (container 2 / the AIO test container).

## ❌ overlay-fix #2 (TRANSLUCENT base) DEVICE-TESTED 2026-06-29 — STILL CLIENT, base regressed. Translucent approach backfired.

Build `e036124` (CI `28378890898` green, manually installed by user). Device = Adreno 750/SD8Gen3, GL|DXVK, AIO DX11 cube, drawer closed. Driven via root bridge (toggle 765,968; dumpsys OFF vs ON).

**THE GATE = FAIL.** dumpsys SurfaceFlinger composition (requested/actual):
- **Native OFF baseline:** base `SurfaceView[…XServerDisplayActivity]` = `composition: DEVICE/DEVICE` ✅ — ONE clean fullscreen HWC overlay, 0 scanout SCs. (FPS 750 / GPU 26% / CPU 90.7°C)
- **Native ON (fix #2):** SC count 0→14 (scanout built, native active, P5 grey-out confirmed, cube renders correct/right colors). BUT:
  - base `SurfaceView` = `composition: DEVICE/CLIENT` ❌ (was DEVICE/DEVICE off — **REGRESSED**, making it translucent did NOT get SF to cull it; it stays in the stack at z:0 and now forces GPU comp)
  - `winlator_game_buf#781` AHB = `DEVICE/CLIENT` ❌ — ROT_90, src 1280×702 → dst 1080×1920 (rotate + 1.5× scale)
  - `winlator_cursor_buf#782` AHB = `DEVICE/CLIENT` ❌
  - VRI + ScreenDecor also CLIENT → **EVERY layer GPU-composited.** (FPS 704 / GPU 28% / CPU 93.1°C = slightly WORSE than off)

**VERDICT:** translucent base = INSUFFICIENT and counterproductive. It didn't make SF skip the base (base still composited, just now blended/CLIENT instead of a clean opaque DEVICE overlay), and the whole frame fell to GPU. So the checkpoint's "opaque competing base is the GL-specific blocker" hypothesis is NOT confirmed by making it translucent — the base being *present at all* (not its opacity) plus the rotate+scale game buffer is what's blocking. **C (HWC overlay) still not happening; only the B win (skipped GL compositor pass) remains, and it's marginal here.**

**▶️ NEXT HYPOTHESES (not yet tried, ranked):**
1. **Make the base GLSurfaceView genuinely BUFFERLESS/absent when scanout active** (like ASR's bufferless base), not merely translucent — currently it's still a composited layer at z:0. If SF still can't drop it, the GLSurfaceView architecture itself may be the wall (can't host children AND vanish).
2. **Drop the SC-level SCALE on the game buffer** — set the game SC to display size via setBuffersGeometry/setGeometry so it carries ONLY ROT_90 (the global display transform), matching GameHub/libwinemu (zero SC-level geometry). The 1280×702→1080×1920 rotate+scale combo is a known Adreno overlay-rejection trigger. (Re-opens old "blocker #2"; checkpoint thought it was wrong but this run keeps it live.)
3. **DECISIVE DIAGNOSTIC: capture Vulkan-native ON dumpsys on the SAME device/scene** and diff layer-for-layer vs this GL one — Vulkan promotes to DEVICE here, so the diff (layer count? base swapchain state? is the Vulkan base even present? buffer geometry/transform?) points straight at the real GL-specific blocker instead of guessing.

⚠️ Container left with Native toggled ON after this test. fix #2 NOT merged (still on branch `feat/gl-scanout-overlay-fix` tip `e036124`).

## 🔬 ROOT-CAUSE DIAGNOSIS 2026-06-29 (graphics-vulkan-engineer code-read, agentId aa8c3b24c81f5e41c) — it's the GLSurfaceView base + child-parenting, NOT geometry/opacity.

Read both scanout paths (Vulkan works→DEVICE, GL fails→CLIENT) against the device evidence. Eliminations:
- **Geometry/SC-scale = RED HERRING.** Both renderers feed the SAME `ScanoutContext::setBuffer` (`ScanoutContext.cpp:173-211`) with transform arg **0** (identity); the ROT_90 you see in dumpsys is the global display orientation applied to EVERY layer (incl base), and the 1280×702→1080×1920 is the inherent src≠dst guest→display scale. This exact block runs on the Vulkan path that DOES promote on this device. So `setBuffersGeometry`/dropping the scale would change nothing GL-specific.
- **Parenting topology = IDENTICAL.** Both parent the game/cursor SCs under `xServerView.getSurfaceControl()` = their own base-view's SC (Vulkan `VulkanRenderer.java:623`, GL `DirectScanout.java:85-89`). Only variable = base VIEW TYPE: plain `SurfaceView` (Vulkan/ASR) vs `GLSurfaceView` (GL).
- **"Base still updating" = NOT it.** Both idle the base after scanout starts (Vulkan `VulkanRendererContext.cpp:1486-1499` renders ONE empty frame then `return`s forever — its plain-SurfaceView BufferQueue genuinely flatlines so SF can drop it; GL mirrors via `setRenderingEnabled(false)`+early-return `GLRenderer.java:262-285,387-395`).

**THE WALL:** `GLSurfaceView` OWNS/manages its own `EGLSurface` (`XServerView.java:102-111`, preserveEGLContextOnPause) → it ALWAYS holds its last fullscreen EGL buffer and can't be made bufferless/absent like a stopped Vulkan swapchain or ASR's bufferless host. AND because the game/cursor SCs are its CHILDREN, you can't hide/remove the base without hiding them (parent setVisibility(false) hides subtree). `setGlSurfaceTranslucent` only changes the holder format → turns the base into a BLENDED fullscreen layer at z=0 that HWC must client-composite → cascades the whole frame to CLIENT = exactly the fix-#2 regression. Matches the GameHub/libwinemu RE: GameHub promotes because it uses a **dedicated standalone surface with no competing base**.

**▶️ RECOMMENDED FIX (a), IMPLEMENT FIRST:** reparent the scanout SCs OFF the GLSurfaceView. Concrete lowest-risk form: add a **dedicated plain `SurfaceView`** sibling of `glSurfaceView` in the `XServerView` FrameLayout, parent game/cursor SCs under THAT SC, and set the GLSurfaceView GONE / its SC invisible while native active → single opaque fullscreen game SC over a clean base = the same topology that already promotes on the Native-OFF baseline AND the Vulkan path. Files: `XServerView.java` (`getSurfaceControl()` :183, add dedicated SurfaceView + base-hide hook by `setGlSurfaceTranslucent` :168), `GLRenderer.enableScanout/disableScanout` (:608/:646), `DirectScanout.enable` (parent arg already generalized). (Plan §3 Fallback-A via `getRootSurfaceControl()` API30+ also works but fussier on lifecycle — dedicated-SurfaceView is closer to the proven Vulkan path.)
- **(b) genuinely bufferless GL base** = SECOND/fallback — needs replacing GLSurfaceView with self-managed EGL-on-SurfaceView (big rewrite, deferred "drop GLSurfaceView" step). (a) reaches the same end-state without it.
- **(c) drop SC scale** = DO NOT — proven not the blocker (shared with working Vulkan path).

**Device tests now CONFIRMATORY, not exploratory:** Vulkan-ON would re-confirm the P0 result (already proven DEVICE on this device); GameHub-GL-ON would independently prove a GL-origin standalone overlay promotes here + hand us the target layer structure. Optional belt-and-suspenders before building fix (a).

## 🧪 GAMEHUB 5.3.5 NATIVE-RENDERING+ DEVICE-TESTED 2026-06-29 — ALSO fails to promote (DEVICE/CLIENT), BUT confounded by windowed-desktop mode.

Ran the upstream reference (GameHub 5.3.5, pkg `com.tencent.ig`/`com.xj.winemu.WineActivity` — basis of Banner Hub 3.8.0) on the SAME Adreno750/SD8Gen3, SAME AIO DX11 cube, DXVK, right-side drawer. "Native Rendering+" is a 3-way radio Auto/Disabled/**Force Enable**. dumpsys composition (requested/actual):
- **Native OFF (Disabled):** `SurfaceView[com.tencent.ig/…WineActivity]#5` = `DEVICE/DEVICE` ✅ (clean fullscreen overlay, RGBX_8888, transform 0, src 720×1280→dst 1080×1920) + VRI `DEVICE/DEVICE`. HUD "DXVK".
- **Native ON (Force Enable):** HUD flips to "DXVK+". ALL layers `DEVICE/CLIENT` ❌ (requested overlay, HWC REJECTED→GPU): base SurfaceView#5 (still PRESENT, RGBX), `AHardwareBuffer pid[27828]` z1 (game, RGBA_8888, transform **90**/ROT_90), `bbq-adapter#1` z2 (RGBA_8888, transform 90), VRI z3. **EXACT same failure shape as our GL path** (base stays present + ROT_90 game AHB + everything rejected to CLIENT).

**⚠️ CRITICAL CONFOUND — GameHub was running its Wine DESKTOP (windowed), NOT a borderless fullscreen game:** taskbar at bottom + title bar + window chrome; the game content layer is INSET (dst 61,2–1035,1919, not fullscreen). A non-fullscreen scene with competing chrome will be rejected for overlay promotion REGARDLESS of renderer. So this is NOT a clean apples-to-apples vs our fullscreen container, and does NOT cleanly serve as the "GL-origin overlay CAN promote here" reference we wanted.

**What it DOES tell us:**
1. GameHub's native path ALSO keeps its base SurfaceView present (doesn't vanish it) and ALSO applies ROT_90+scale on the game AHB — so the libwinemu-RE "zero SC-level geometry / standalone surface, no competing base" claim is NOT what this build does in desktop mode. (RE may describe fullscreen-game path or a different code branch.)
2. It does NOT refute the engineer's diagnosis for OUR GL-vs-Vulkan: that remains a CLEAN A/B (same container, same fullscreen config, same scene — only renderer differs; Vulkan promotes to DEVICE, GL doesn't). The GameHub non-promotion is explained by windowing.

**▶️ To make GameHub a decisive reference: re-run it with a BORDERLESS FULLSCREEN game (no taskbar/title bar).** If fullscreen GameHub promotes → confirms fullscreen+standalone-surface is the recipe (supports fix (a)). If even fullscreen GameHub stays CLIENT on this device → this Adreno750/Android build may be stingy about overlays generally (re-scope expectations). Meanwhile fix (a) is still well-founded on our own Vulkan A/B (the clean fullscreen proof that this geometry promotes on this device).
⚠️ Left GameHub with Native Rendering+ = Force Enable; may have toggled "RTS Touch Controls" on the Controls page (harmless, cosmetic).

---

## 🚨 GAMEHUB 5.3.5 FULLSCREEN Native-ON DEVICE-TESTED 2026-06-29 — STILL CLIENT even fullscreen+base-dropped. Blocker looks DEVICE-LEVEL (rotated non-UBWC buffer), not our GLSurfaceView.

Re-ran GameHub as a BORDERLESS FULLSCREEN game (no taskbar/title bar — confirmed via screenshot, cube fills screen + horizontal top HUD bar "DXVK+"), Native Rendering+ = Force Enable, drawer closed. SAME Adreno750/SD8Gen3.
- **The base WineActivity SurfaceView is GONE from the active HWC set** (in fullscreen GameHub DID drop its base — unlike windowed-desktop where it stayed). Game buffer is now z:0 (bottom).
- **Yet STILL no promotion — ALL `DEVICE/CLIENT`:** `AHardwareBuffer pid[32674]` z0 (game, RGBA_8888, **transform 90**), `bbq-adapter#1` z1 (RGBA_8888, **transform 90**), `VRI[WineActivity]` z2 (RGBA_8888_UBWC, transform 0). HWC requested overlay, rejected every layer to GPU.

**🔑 PATTERN across EVERY capture today (sharp):**
- Layers that PROMOTE (`DEVICE/DEVICE`): `RGBX/RGBA_8888_UBWC`, **transform 0**. (GameHub OFF baseline base SurfaceView; our Native-OFF GL base.)
- Layers that get REJECTED (`DEVICE/CLIENT`): `RGBA_8888` NON-UBWC, **transform 90** (ROT_90). (our GL game AHB; GameHub game AHB windowed AND fullscreen.)
→ Strongly suggests a **device/DPU limitation: this Adreno display controller won't HWC-overlay a ROTATED, non-UBWC AHardwareBuffer** (Adreno rotator typically requires UBWC; a transform-90 linear buffer is overlay-ineligible → forced CLIENT, and one ineligible layer drags the whole frame to CLIENT). The landscape-game→portrait-panel 90° rotation is the likely poison.

**⚠️ THIS WEAKENS "just do fix (a)":** fix (a) = reparent scanout SCs off the GLSurfaceView + drop the base. But GameHub fullscreen ALREADY effectively does that (base dropped, standalone game buffer) and STILL doesn't promote. So dropping the competing base is necessary-but-NOT-sufficient on this device — the rotated non-UBWC buffer itself is rejected.

**🎯 THE NOW-DECISIVE TEST (no longer redundant): capture OUR Bannerlator VULKAN native-ON game buffer's composition + TRANSFORM + FORMAT on this device.** Our P0 gate recorded Vulkan promotes to `DEVICE` (BGRA_8888) but did NOT record the transform. Two outcomes:
- If Vulkan promotes with transform 90 + non-UBWC → then GameHub/GL rejection is something else (layer count? a GameHub quirk?) and the rotation theory is wrong — re-examine.
- If Vulkan's promoting buffer is transform 0 (pre-rotated content) or UBWC → THAT is the recipe: the GL/native path must deliver a pre-rotated and/or UBWC buffer so the DPU can overlay it. Fix shifts from "reparent" to "fix the buffer orientation/format."
(Earlier I called the Vulkan capture redundant — this GameHub result makes it the key missing measurement.)

⚠️ Left GameHub fullscreen + Native+=Force Enable.

---

## 🚨🚨 BOMBSHELL 2026-06-29 — OUR VULKAN NATIVE ALSO DOES NOT PROMOTE ON THIS DEVICE. The whole "Vulkan promotes / GL doesn't" premise is FALSE. Blocker = the 90° rotation (landscape game → portrait panel), device-level, renderer-agnostic.

Captured OUR Bannerlator **Vulkan|DXVK** native-ON dumpsys (same Adreno750/SD8Gen3, same AIO cube, Native ON confirmed via screenshot — Renderer: Vulkan|DXVK, P5 grey-out active, 564fps/GPU20%):
- `SurfaceView[com.winlator.banner/…XServerDisplayActivity]#2` z0 = `DEVICE/CLIENT` ❌ (RGBA_8888_UBWC, **transform 90**)
- `AHardwareBuffer pid[5980]` z1 = `DEVICE/CLIENT` ❌ (BGRA_8888, **transform 90**) = the game buffer
- `VRI[XServerDisplayActivity]` z2 = `DEVICE/CLIENT` ❌ (RGBA_8888_UBWC, transform 0)
- HWC layers table shows winlator_game_buf actual = **CLIENT**; active `---------client target---------` = full GPU composition. **NO overlay.**

**⛔ This means our Vulkan native NEVER actually promoted on this device.** The P0 gate's "winlator_game_buf composition type=DEVICE = HWC overlay confirmed" was a **MISREAD of the REQUESTED composition type** (the HWC hint column says DEVICE = "SF asked for overlay") **not the ACTUAL** (post-validateDisplay = CLIENT = HWC rejected → GPU). Every native-render path requests DEVICE; this device rejects them all.

**🔑 NOW the picture is consistent across ALL FOUR captures today:**
| Path | game buf | result |
|---|---|---|
| Bannerlator Vulkan native ON | BGRA_8888, ROT_90 | DEVICE/**CLIENT** ❌ |
| Bannerlator GL native ON | BGRA/RGBA, ROT_90 | DEVICE/**CLIENT** ❌ |
| GameHub native ON (windowed) | RGBA_8888, ROT_90 | DEVICE/**CLIENT** ❌ |
| GameHub native ON (fullscreen, base dropped) | RGBA_8888, ROT_90 | DEVICE/**CLIENT** ❌ |
| (any renderer) Native OFF baseline | UBWC, **transform 0** | DEVICE/**DEVICE** ✅ |

**ROOT CAUSE = the 90° rotation.** This is a PORTRAIT-NATIVE panel (SF display 1080×1920); the game runs landscape and the direct-scanout buffer is handed to SurfaceFlinger with **transform=ROT_90** so the DPU must rotate it for display. This Adreno DPU/HWC will NOT take a rotated layer as an overlay (rotation on the overlay path is unsupported / disqualifying here) → falls back to GPU/CLIENT for the whole frame. In the Native-OFF baseline the app's own compositor bakes the rotation into a transform-0 UBWC surface, which DOES promote. So: rotation baked-in (OFF) = overlayable; rotation requested on the scanout layer (ON) = rejected.

## ⛳ STRATEGIC CONSEQUENCES (big)
1. **The "C win" (true HWC hardware overlay, GPU idle) is NOT achievable on this portrait device for landscape content — for ANY renderer.** Not a GL bug, not a Vulkan win. It's a display-rotation/DPU limitation.
2. **fix (a) / the whole GLSurfaceView-base theory is MOOT for overlay promotion** — Vulkan uses a plain SurfaceView and STILL doesn't promote. Dropping the GL base would not unlock the overlay. Stop the overlay-fix branch attempts (fix#1 idle, fix#2 translucent, proposed fix(a) reparent) — they chase an unattainable C on this device.
3. **What native rendering DOES deliver here = the "B win"** (skip the app's own compositor blit + change present pacing → lower latency / the real feel the user reports). That is renderer-agnostic and ALREADY delivered by P4/P5. So GL native = latency PARITY with Vulkan; both get B, neither gets C on this device.
4. **The C win likely WORKS on a LANDSCAPE-NATIVE panel** (game buffer arrives transform 0, no DPU rotation needed) — e.g. AYANEO/landscape handhelds. The feature isn't useless; its overlay benefit is display-orientation-dependent.

## ▶️ RECOMMENDED NEW DIRECTION
- **Re-scope native rendering = a latency/pacing feature (B), not an overlay feature (C)**, on portrait devices. Document that HWC-overlay promotion needs a transform-0 (landscape-native) path.
- **Salvage the GL work:** merge P4+P5 (the functional per-frame push + effect grey-out) as "GL native rendering (latency parity)", DROP the failed overlay-fix commits (#1 idle, #2 translucent) — they targeted C. Reconcile branch PROGRESS_LOG.
- **Two confirmations worth doing (cheap):** (1) capture native-ON on a **landscape-native device** (AYANEO) — if game buf = transform 0 → DEVICE, the rotation theory is proven and C works there. (2) optional: try forcing this container/display to landscape-native orientation and re-capture — if it promotes, we have a per-device path.
⚠️ Vulkan container left Native ON.

## 🔁 LANDSCAPE LONG-SHOT DEVICE-TESTED 2026-06-29 — DID NOT help; but revealed the ROT_90 is applied by the SCANOUT CODE, not system orientation.

User forced the whole Android system to landscape, ran AIO cube on GL|DXVK, Native ON, drawer closed. (Note: forcing orientation RESTARTS the XServerDisplayActivity → reloads container; came back OpenGL/Native-off, re-enabled Native.) dumpsys (composition | format | transform):
- base `SurfaceView[…XServerDisplayActivity]#2` z0 = DEVICE/**CLIENT** ❌, RGBA_8888_UBWC, **transform 0** (now 0 because the activity surface follows the landscape system)
- game `AHardwareBuffer pid[17795]` z1 = DEVICE/**CLIENT** ❌, BGRA_8888, **transform 90** ← STILL ROTATED even though system is landscape
- cursor `AHardwareBuffer pid[17527]` z2 = DEVICE/**CLIENT** ❌, RGBA_8888, transform 90
- VRI z3 = DEVICE/**CLIENT** ❌, UBWC, transform 0

**KEY NEW INSIGHT:** the base surface went transform 0 in landscape (follows system), but the **GAME scanout buffer is STILL transform 90**. So the 90° rotation on the game buffer is applied by the **native-rendering handoff itself** (ScanoutContext/DirectScanout sets the buffer's transform), NOT by the global display orientation as previously assumed. Forcing landscape therefore could NOT remove it → still a rotated layer in the stack → HWC still rejects the WHOLE frame to CLIENT (the transform-0 UBWC base + VRI get dragged to CLIENT too, exactly as the pattern predicts). The cube still displays CORRECTLY with ROT_90+landscape (so the rotation is currently part of producing the right image — naively removing it would likely break orientation).

**CONCLUSION: landscape long-shot = DEAD END on this device with current code.** The overlay still doesn't engage. The blocker (rotated game buffer, overlay-ineligible on this Adreno DPU) is confirmed and is baked into the scanout handoff.

**One UNTESTED lever this surfaces (speculative, code change):** make the scanout transform ORIENTATION-AWARE — deliver the game buffer at transform 0 when the display is genuinely landscape-native (and ensure buffer dims match), so no rotated layer is in the stack. MIGHT promote + still display correctly IF the guest render orientation is adjusted to match. Risky (orientation/fit), unproven, and GameHub doesn't do it. NOT recommended without the engineer validating it's even coherent. The safe path remains: re-scope native = latency (B) feature, salvage P4+P5, and confirm the true overlay win on a genuinely landscape-native panel where the buffer naturally needs no rotation.

## ✅ SALVAGE MERGE 2026-06-29 — P4+P5 landed on main as "GL Native Rendering (Low-Latency Mode)"; dead overlay-fix reverted.

Per user direction ("give me P4 and P5 with a solid explanation for the next release"), after today's findings (overlay/C-win unattainable on this portrait device for ANY renderer; native = latency/B-win feature):
- **Reverted `7aaacaf`** (overlay-fix #2 translucent base — was the ONLY overlay-fix code that had reached main; proven dead/counterproductive on device today). Revert `ee63ab1` (-43 lines, restores clean P3 base).
- **Cherry-picked P4 (`d44b560`→`fcaf104`)** per-frame game push + **P5 (`64b7cfb`→`ba0d35d`)** effect/scaling grey-out onto the clean base (authored against 2fe3f10 = post-revert state → applied with ZERO conflicts). Verified: GLRenderer.presentScanout present, XServerDrawer glEnabled present.
- main now = P0+P1+P2+P3+P4+P5, NO overlay-fix code. P4+P5 were device-proven FUNCTIONAL (native active, game renders correct, P5 grey-out works) — only the overlay promotion failed, which we're no longer claiming.
- **NOT cutting a release** (per versioning rule — no tag/make_latest without explicit say-so). Release notes prepared at `docs/release_notes/gl_native_rendering.md` (paste-ready, honest: latency feature, effects mutually exclusive, power/overlay win is device/orientation-dependent).
- Dropped (NOT merged, stay on branch `feat/gl-scanout-overlay-fix`): overlay-fix #1 idle base (`b418e53`), overlay-fix #2 translucent (`e036124`) — both chase the unattainable C-win.
- ▶️ NEXT: CI build to confirm green on main; (optional, when available) confirm the overlay/power win on a landscape-native device (AYANEO).

## 🔬 PRE-ROTATION FEASIBILITY (graphics-vulkan-engineer, 2026-06-29) — reframes "rotation is THE blocker" as CONFOUNDED; cheap diagnostic experiment identified.

**Key correction (to my own conclusion):** "transform-0 promotes / transform-90 rejects → rotation is the blocker" is CONFOUNDED. The only transform-0 layer ever seen promoting is the BASE SurfaceView, which differs from the rejected game AHB in FOUR ways at once:
| | promoting base | rejected game AHB |
|---|---|---|
| transform | 0 | 90 |
| tiling | UBWC | non-UBWC/linear |
| usage | composer/scanout-grade | lacks COMPOSER_OVERLAY |
| geometry | full-screen 1:1 | scaled 1280×702→1080×1920 |
Rotation is ONE suspect; **non-UBWC + missing COMPOSER_OVERLAY usage is an independent, very-likely-decisive co-blocker that pre-rotation would NOT fix** (and is renderer-agnostic → would explain why Vulkan also fails).

**Where ROT_90 comes from (Q1): NOT our code.** Every scanout `setGeometry` passes transform 0 (`ScanoutContext.cpp:196` game, `:256` cursor; ASR `:246,383`). No `ASurfaceTransaction_setBufferTransform` anywhere in the scanout path (symbol only loaded by ASR `ASurfaceRendererContext.cpp:120`, unused). The ROT_90 is **SurfaceFlinger folding the display/window orientation** onto the layer: a landscape container runs the activity landscape on a portrait-native 1080×1920 panel (`XServerDisplayActivity.java:1015-1019` only locks PORTRAIT for portrait containers), so SF must rotate the game child-SC's fixed landscape guest buffer 90° to reach the panel.

**Critical wrinkle:** the game scanout buffer is **GUEST-allocated (Mesa/turnip Android WSI export), received zero-copy over socket** (`DRI3Extension.java:154-156`→`GPUImage(fd)`→`AHardwareBuffer_recvHandleFromUnixSocket` `gpu_image.c:81`). The host `createHardwareBuffer` (`gpu_image.c:88-97`, lacks COMPOSER_OVERLAY, CPU_WRITE_OFTEN/BGRA→linear) is only the CPU/SHM fallback, NOT game frames. So we do NOT control the game buffer's tiling/usage/format host-side without COPYING.

**Pre-rotation verdict (Q2-Q4):** Option (a) — render the guest frame via a GL pass into a HOST AHB allocated COMPOSER_OVERLAY+UBWC-friendly at panel res — is feasible and fixes 3 of 4 differences at once (transform, usage/tiling, scale). BUT re-introduces a per-frame GPU blit → "zero-GPU" dream gone; remaining win = direct HWC scanout + lower latency, MODEST over today's GL compositor. Option (b) just-force-transform-0 = sideways image (we don't set ROT_90; forcing it 0 without rotating pixels mis-orients). Option (c) patch guest WSI to allocate scanout-grade buffers = no host copy but Mesa/turnip change (wine-compat), risky, leaves rotation. Honest promotion odds even with pre-rotation: MODERATE — usage/UBWC, the scale, BGRA, and plane budget could each independently block.

**▶️ RECOMMENDED EXPERIMENT A (cheapest, isolates the most-likely + unexamined blocker, host-only ~40-60 lines GL):** in `GLRenderer.presentScanout`, blit the guest GPUImage into a host AHB allocated `GPU_SAMPLED_IMAGE|COMPOSER_OVERLAY` RGBA_8888 (reuse cursor alloc pattern `ScanoutContext.cpp:279-285`), KEEPING transform 90 + scale, present THAT. dumpsys: if game flips CLIENT→DEVICE at transform 90 → rotation was a red herring, blocker was usage/UBWC (renderer-agnostic, ~done). If still CLIENT → rotation implicated → Experiment B (add 90° rotate + render at exact 1080×1920 + lock portrait for the probe, accept wrong cursor/HUD). 
Key files: `ScanoutContext.cpp:185-196,256,279-285`, `gpu_image.c:81,88-97`, `GPUImage.java:18-38`, `DRI3Extension.java:154-156`, `GLRenderer.java presentScanout ~:725`, `XServerDisplayActivity.java:1015-1019`.

**✅ CI GREEN on main (run `28388609799`) — P4+P5 salvage compiles clean in the fresh main combination (revert `ee63ab1` + P4 `fcaf104` + P5 `ba0d35d`). GL Native Rendering (Low-Latency Mode) is now build-verified on main. Release notes ready at docs/release_notes/gl_native_rendering.md; no release cut.**

**🧪 EXPERIMENT A BUILT (graphics-vulkan-engineer, 2026-06-29) — branch `exp/gl-scanout-composer-overlay-ahb` (`75115bb`, off main `9c7156c`, NOT merged). CI run `28390468273`.** GL native path blits the guest game AHB (one passthrough quad, SAME size/orientation/scale, NO pre-rotation) into a HOST AHB allocated `GPU_SAMPLED|GPU_FRAMEBUFFER|COMPOSER_OVERLAY` (BGRA_8888, swapRB still applies), presents THAT — isolates buffer-usage/UBWC hypothesis from ROT_90. Files: `gpu_image.c` createScanoutHardwareBuffer JNI; `GPUImage.java` scanout ctor; NEW `ScanoutBlitMaterial.java` (passthrough+V-flip); `GLRenderer.presentScanout` rewritten to marshal blit to GL thread (queueEvent+latch, epoll thread has no GL ctx) +ensureHostScanout/releaseHostScanout. Fallback: alloc/FBO/roundtrip fail or 3 timeouts → sticky-revert to direct guest present (never black-screens). +1 quad blit/frame. Caveat: samples guest tex post-unlock w/o write-fence → rare tearing on fast frames (irrelevant to signal). **DEVICE GATE: GL+Native ON, dumpsys winlator_game_buf CLIENT→DEVICE at transform 90? YES=usage/UBWC was blocker (rotation red herring, likely renderer-agnostic→explains Vulkan). STILL CLIENT=rotation implicated→Experiment B. Confirm cube renders correct (V-flip=1-line lever, doesn't affect reading).**

## 🧪 EXPERIMENT A DEVICE-TESTED 2026-06-29 — PROBE ENGAGED, but COMPOSER_OVERLAY usage RULED OUT as the blocker. Game still CLIENT.
GL container, Native ON, drawer closed, Adreno750. dumpsys: game `AHardwareBuffer` is now **pid 11930 (= the app process, `pidof com.winlator.banner`=11930 → host blit ENGAGED)**, buffer-cache `usage: 0xb00` (= COMPOSER_OVERLAY 0x800 + GPU_FRAMEBUFFER 0x200 + GPU_SAMPLED 0x100, no CPU flags) — vs the original guest buffer's 0x333. So the host AHB with COMPOSER_OVERLAY IS what's presented. **YET STILL `composition: DEVICE/CLIENT` (rejected), transform 90, BGRA_8888 non-UBWC (compressed:false), still scaled 1280×702→1080×1920.** Content rendered (not black; fallback did NOT trigger; no V-flip black-screen). 
**⇒ COMPOSER_OVERLAY usage flag is NOT the blocker (set it, still rejected). Engineer's leading hypothesis disproven.** Remaining co-varying suspects on the game layer vs the (would-promote) base: **(1) transform 90 (rotation), (2) non-UBWC/linear (base is RGBA_8888_UBWC), (3) the SC-level scale.** Note also: the base SurfaceView (UBWC/transform0) is ALSO DEVICE/CLIENT here while it was DEVICE/DEVICE in the OFF baseline → the rotated game layer poisons the whole stack to client (or plane budget). 
**▶️ Experiment B (the likely-decisive next probe): pre-rotate the blit + render the host AHB at exact panel res (1920×1080 so ROT_90→1080×1920 = NO SC scale), lock portrait for the probe. Neutralizes rotation AND scale at once, leaving only UBWC.** If B promotes → rotation/scale was it (path exists, w/ cursor/orientation plumbing cost). If B still CLIENT → it's UBWC (hard/maybe-impossible to force on a GL render-target AHB on Adreno) or fundamental → gate GL-native overlay unsupported on portrait; the clean overlay win stays the landscape-native-device path. Honest: diminishing returns; even B success = modest win (per-frame blit + plumbing); landscape-native handheld remains the clean payoff.

## 🧪 EXPERIMENT B BUILT (graphics-vulkan-engineer, 2026-06-29) — branch `exp/gl-scanout-prerotate-panelres` (`8b20b96`, stacked on Exp A `75115bb`, NOT merged). CI run `28392607613`.
Extends Exp A: host scanout AHB allocated at PANEL res (1080×1920, portrait-locked), blit ROTATES guest frame 90° into it (new `ScanoutBlitRot90Material`, UV transpose) so content is display-oriented, then presents at **transform 0, src==dst (no SC scale)** via setContainerSize/setDst(0,0,pw,ph). Activity portrait-locked during native (`setProbeOrientation(true)` in enableScanout, restore sensorLandscape on native-off; configChanges has orientation|screenSize → reconfigure in place, NO activity recreation). Keeps COMPOSER_OVERLAY usage + the sticky fallback (alloc/FBO/roundtrip fail or 3 timeouts → direct guest present, never black). Files: NEW `ScanoutBlitRot90Material.java`; `GLRenderer.java` (blitGuestIntoHostScanoutAndPresent → panel-res+rotate+transform0/src==dst, setProbeOrientation, portrait lock wiring). DIAGNOSTIC: cursor/HUD/input + image orientation intentionally WRONG — only the dumpsys reading + not-black matter. **DEVICE GATE: GL+Native ON, dumpsys winlator_game_buf = `DEVICE/DEVICE` at transform 0? DEVICE→rotation/scale was the blocker (path exists w/ cursor/orientation plumbing). STILL CLIENT→UBWC/compression or fundamental→gate GL-native overlay unsupported on portrait; landscape-native device = the win.** Confirm cube image present (rotated/odd = fine, just not black).

## 🟢🟢 EXPERIMENT B DEVICE-TESTED (2026-06-29, post-crash resume) — PROMOTES! TRUE HWC OVERLAY ON THE PORTRAIT DEVICE. The "C-win unattainable on portrait" bombshell is OVERTURNED.
Device "Pocket FIT" Adreno750/SD8Gen3, GL|DXVK, AIO DX11 cube, Native ON (game already foreground after the session crash; 14 scanout SCs alive; captured with drawer open — promotion holds with drawer up).

**DPU/SDM hardware composition pipe table (ground truth — the Snapdragon Display Engine's actual scanout plan, NOT a requested-hint column, so immune to the earlier requested-vs-actual misread):**
- idx0 base SurfaceView  RGBA_8888_UBWC  = SDE  (overlay)
- idx1 **GAME  BGRA_8888  = SDE pipe149, src 0 0 1080 1920 -> dst 0 0 1080 1920 (NO SCALE), Transform 0**
- idx2 cursor  RGBA_8888 16x16  = SDE
- idx3 VRI  RGBA_8888_UBWC  = SDE
- idx5 GPU_TARGET = **NO layers assigned = GPU does ZERO composition**

Raw HWC `layer:` list corroborates (game/cursor are named `AHardwareBuffer pid[15581]` = the app process = exp-B host-blit AHB, NOT `winlator_*` — that's why the first grep missed them):
- game  z1  `composition: DEVICE/DEVICE`  BGRA_8888  transform 0/0/0
- cursor z2 `composition: DEVICE/DEVICE`  RGBA_8888  transform 0/0/0
- base + VRI  `composition: DEVICE/DEVICE`  RGBA_8888_UBWC  transform 0/0/0
- count of `DEVICE/CLIENT` + `CLIENT/CLIENT` across the whole dump = **0**

Screenshot (scratchpad/eb1.png) = image produced, not black (Wine window chrome visible on the strip beside the open drawer; orientation/aspect intentionally wrong per the diagnostic design).

**VERDICT: the HWC-overlay blocker was ROTATION (transform 90) + SCALE (src != dst) TOGETHER — NOT UBWC, NOT GLSurfaceView, NOT portrait-orientation-per-se.** Pre-rotating the guest frame 90° into a panel-res (1080x1920) host AHB (so it's display-oriented = transform 0) + presenting src==dst (no SC-level scale) + portrait-locking the activity => this Adreno DPU accepts a **plain non-UBWC BGRA_8888** buffer on a hardware overlay pipe.

**Overturns:** (a) bombshell "C-win unattainable on this portrait device for ANY renderer" = FALSE — C IS attainable, you must hand the DPU a transform-0, unscaled buffer; (b) the "UBWC required" hypothesis (Exp A's last suspect) = FALSE (game promoted as plain BGRA_8888); (c) the landscape long-shot finding (ROT_90 applied by the scanout handoff, not the display orientation) = CONFIRMED as the cause, and Exp B's pre-rotation is the fix.

**Exp B is a DIAGNOSTIC THROWAWAY (branch `exp/gl-scanout-prerotate-panelres` `8b20b96`, do-NOT-merge as-is):** hardcoded 90° UV-transpose one direction; cursor/HUD/input/aspect intentionally wrong; extra full-frame GPU blit + GL-thread roundtrip per frame; portrait-lock hack.

**Next (decision pending with user) — productionize C-win on portrait vs. ship latency-only:** orientation-aware correct pre-rotation (all 4 rotations, right handedness/flip), fix cursor/HUD/input mapping under the rotated present, weigh the host-blit cost (extra blit + roundtrip + possible base double-buffer) against the overlay/GPU-idle win — vs. just keeping the already-merged latency-only P4+P5. Container left Native ON, exp-B build installed, Claude/Termux session brought back to foreground.

## ⏸️ PHASE 0 (GL native overlay portrait — power/perf A/B) STARTED then PAUSED by user (2026-06-29) — SETUP ONLY, NO NUMBERS. Resume when home.
User chose to run P0 (measure-first), then stopped it (about to lose Wi-Fi). Reached SETUP only; no OFF/ON numbers captured. Partial log: `scratchpad/p0_results.md`.

Resume state:
- Test container = `xuser-3` "P11 x86-64" (renderer=opengl, rendererNative=false). exp-B build (`exp/gl-scanout-prerotate-panelres` `8b20b96`) is the installed/active APK.
- **Container config WAS MODIFIED:** DXVK `dxwrapperConfig` framerate `0`->`60` (maxFrameRate, guest-side cap for matched-FPS A/B). **Backup at `<imagefs>/home/xuser-3/.container.p0bak`.** Keep the 60 cap to resume P0, or restore from backup to abandon.
- Termux/Claude session brought back to foreground.

Resume recipe: launch GL container xuser-3 -> AIO DX11 cube -> enable perf HUD -> State A Native OFF (dwell ~30s, 3+ samples) -> State B Native ON (toggle in drawer, dwell ~30s, same samples). Sample {`/sys/class/kgsl/kgsl-3d0/gpu_busy_percentage`, `gpuclk`, `/sys/class/power_supply/battery/current_now` uA, thermal_zone temp, displayed FPS}. Confirm overlay via dumpsys SDE pipe table (ON: game AHB DEVICE/DEVICE on SDE pipe + GPU_TARGET empty; OFF: base SurfaceView DEVICE/DEVICE, no game AHB). VERDICT: ON lower GPU% AND power at equal FPS -> portrait worth productionizing; flat/worse -> drop portrait, headline the free landscape-native win.


## 🔴 STEAM DOWNLOAD FIX (2026-07-03) — LogonSessionReplaced regression on rebuilt stack (#1+#2+#4). Branch `feat/steam-goldberg-patcher`.
**Symptom:** After a successful sign-in, Steam game downloads fail on the detail page: "Download failed: Steam session not ready — sign in again or retry in a moment" (device: HL2 appId 220, davidroethlein@comcast.net). Foreground-service notification stuck at "Connecting to Steam…".

**Evidence:**
- `steam_debug.txt`: `SteamClient: connected=true, loggedIn=false` → `Not logged in — waiting for session…` → `ensureLoggedIn → false` after 15s. File does NOT record WHY.
- logcat (SteamRepo) is where the reason lives:
  ```
  17:47:11.851 Connected to Steam CM / Auto-login as davidroethlein@comcast.net
  17:47:12.857 Logged in as davidroethlein@comcast.net        ← login SUCCEEDS
  17:47:12–17:47:17 Library sync (229 apps, depot filter) — ALL on pump thread 23943 (blocks callbacks ~5s)
  17:47:17.191 Library sync complete: 229 apps
  17:47:17.191 Logged off: LogonSessionReplaced               ← queued LoggedOff dispatched the instant pump freed
  ```

**Root cause (self-inflicted double-login):** The Steam stack was REBUILT and lost the old `feat/steam-detail-revamp` fixes (single-flight logon `ceeeeb5`, dead-token `e383393` — never merged into the goldberg line). So: TWO logons fire for the same account — foreground-service `onConnected` auto-login (SteamRepository.java:436) + interactive `SteamLoginActivity.kt:197` loginWithToken — neither guarded. The 2nd replaces the 1st; Steam sends `LoggedOff: LogonSessionReplaced` for the older session; `onLoggedOff` (:506) treats that as TERMINAL (emits LoggedOut, no recovery) and clobbers the good LoggedOn's `loggedIn=true` → stuck `connected=true, loggedIn=false` → every download "session not ready". The 5s library sync on the single pump thread delays the LoggedOff so it lands AFTER the good LoggedOn, guaranteeing the clobber.

**Fixes applied (#1+#2+#4):**
1. **Single-flight logon guard** — `loginWithToken` skips if already `loggedIn` or a logon is in flight (`loggingOn` AtomicBoolean + `logonStartedAt`; supersede only a stalled logon >LOGON_STALL_MS=12s so we can't lock out forever). Released in onLoggedOn/onLoggedOff/onDisconnected. Kills the double logon at the source.
2. **No self-kill on LogonSessionReplaced** — `onLoggedOff` treats a `LogonSessionReplaced` arriving within SELF_REPLACE_WINDOW_MS=15s of our own logon (`lastSelfLogonAt`) as self-inflicted → ignores it (does NOT clear loggedIn or emit LoggedOut; the newer session is live). Genuine/old replacement (real "logged in elsewhere") still surfaces LoggedOut as before.
3. **Log the reason into steam_debug.txt (#4)** — repo records `lastSessionStatus` (LoggedIn / LoginFailed:<r> / LoggedOff:<r>); SteamDepotDownloader dlogs it into steam_debug.txt when ensureLoggedIn fails, so the file the UI points to actually contains the cause next time.

**Deferred:** #3 (move library sync off the pump thread) and #5 (wire the "Connecting to Steam…" notification to real state — currently dead `updateNotification`). Separate follow-up.

**Status:** ✅ implemented + committed `c72d943` (The412Banner) + pushed `feat/steam-goldberg-patcher`. CI is `workflow_dispatch` (not on-push) → manually dispatched **CI Build (artifacts only) run `28685150972`** on sha c72d943 (building, ~16min). Key files: `SteamRepository.java` (single-flight guard `loggingOn`/`logonStartedAt`/`lastSelfLogonAt`, self-replace branch in onLoggedOn/onLoggedOff/onDisconnected, `getLastSessionStatus()`), `SteamDepotDownloader.kt` (dlog `lastSessionStatus` on ensureLoggedIn-fail).
**NEXT (device-test once green):** install APK, download HL2 (appId 220) end-to-end. Pass = NO `Logged off: LogonSessionReplaced` teardown in logcat + download proceeds past manifest. If it still fails, `steam_debug.txt` now prints `Session status at failure: <reason>`. Deferred #3 (library sync off pump thread) + #5 (FGS notification) remain.
