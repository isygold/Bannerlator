## ⭐ About

**Bannerlator** is an Android app that runs Windows PC games and applications natively on your phone or handheld — no streaming, no PC required. Under the hood it pairs **Wine** with **Box64/Box86** (and **FEXCore**) for x86 translation, **DXVK / VKD3D-Proton** for Direct3D-over-Vulkan, and a **Turnip** Vulkan driver, so your games render with the best performance the hardware can give.

Sign in once and your **Steam, Amazon, GOG and Epic Games** libraries come with you — installed, managed and launched right from the app.

Bannerlator carries the Winlator *Star Bionic* line forward with a modern **Jetpack Compose** interface, restored controller support, an in-game overlay, a full theme system, and a clean **GitHub Actions** build-and-release pipeline. It is a personal, community-driven continuation — see the [Project Notice](#-project-notice) below.

## 📌 Project Notice

> **Bannerlator is a personal continuation of the Winlator *Star Bionic* project, which was recently discontinued and archived.**
>
> **None of the original developers are involved except me ([The412Banner](https://github.com/The412Banner)).** This project would not be possible without their hard work up to this point, together with cherry-picked commits from other open-source projects across the community — all credited below.
>
> This is **my personal build.** As always, it is **free for anyone to use as they see fit, or to share.**
