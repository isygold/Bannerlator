## 📌 Project Notice

> **Bannerlator is a personal build — made by me ([The412Banner](https://github.com/The412Banner)), for my own device, my own needs, and my own use.**
>
> It's a personal continuation of the Winlator *Star Bionic* project ([star-emu/star](https://github.com/star-emu/star)) after it was discontinued and archived. None of the original developers are involved except me; it stands on their work plus cherry-picked commits from across the community — all credited below.
>
> **This is NOT an official or general-purpose Winlator release.** It is built and tuned for *my* hardware and *my* workflow, and published **as-is** purely in case it happens to be useful to someone else.
>
> - **No guarantee it works on any other device, GPU, or Android version.**
> - **No support, and no commitment to fix anything that works for me but not for you.** If a feature works on my device, it isn't broken — for me, which is what this build is for.
> - Bug reports / feature requests for setups I don't run may simply be closed. That's not personal; this just isn't a community-support project.
>
> You're **free to use, modify, fork, or share it** (GPL-3.0). If it doesn't work on your setup, that's expected — it wasn't built for it.

## 🆕 What's New in 2.0

The graphics-enhancement program is now **complete across both renderers**, plus a redesigned game/container UI, a few quality-of-life features, and broader device support. 1.9.2 brought real spatial upscaling and the full effect chain to the **Vulkan** renderer; **2.0 brings the same upscaler suite to the OpenGL renderer**, retunes every sharpness slider, fixes the magnifier, redesigns the game and container cards, auto-closes a session when the game quits, adds a FEXCore TSO preset, and **adds Turnip support for Android 10 / older devices**.

**🖼️ OpenGL renderer upscalers (new) — full parity with Vulkan.** The same **Scaling mode** picker is now live in the in-game drawer on the **OpenGL** renderer too: **SGSR**, **FSR** / **FSR-Fit**, **Sharpen**, plus **Linear** / **Nearest**. The OpenGL path renders the scene at a reduced internal resolution and reconstructs it back up — so you can get a sharper image *and* a performance headroom on the OpenGL renderer, not just Vulkan.

**🎚️ Retuned sharpness sliders (both renderers).** Every sharpness slider now spans a clean, useful range — **0 = off (no sharpening at all)** through **100 = maximum**:
- **SGSR** sharpness range **doubled** for a much stronger effect at the top end.
- **FSR / Sharpen** now pass through completely untouched at 0 (previously they always added a little sharpening).
- The **Sharpen** mode snaps to **5 clear steps** (0 / 25 / 50 / 75 / 100), since its sharpening has five discrete levels — no more dead slider travel.

**🛠️ OpenGL renderer plumbing.** The **filter mode** (Nearest / Linear) is now a real, live setting on the OpenGL renderer — the in-game cursor stays sharp under Nearest — and trivial copy stages use a faster `glBlitFramebuffer` path.

**🃏 Redesigned game & container cards.** The **Games** list and **Containers** list now share a cleaner, consistent card design: a primary row of chips (renderer · DXVK · frame-gen) over a muted secondary line (driver · VKD3D · backend), with the resolution in the subtitle. This also fixes long driver / component names crowding out or blanking the game title and pushing the ⋮ menu off-screen.

**🚪 Auto-close on game exit.** When you launch a game from the library or a shortcut, the Wine session now **closes itself once the game quits** — no more black Wine desktop left behind. There's a per-container **"Close when game exits"** toggle (on by default) and a per-shortcut override.

**🔍 Magnifier fixed.** The in-game **Magnifier** (zoom) overlay now works on the **default Vulkan renderer** (and the others) — previously its +/− buttons did nothing unless you were on OpenGL.

**⚙️ FEXCore "Performance (TSO)" preset (new).** A new built-in FEXCore preset: Performance settings with **Total Store Ordering** enabled — for the many games that need correct memory ordering without paying the full TSO cost.

**📱 Turnip on Android 10 / older devices (new).** A new **`turnip-26.1.0`** graphics-driver option loads Mesa Turnip as a **direct system Vulkan ICD** instead of through the adrenotools hook, so it works on **Android versions below 11** (e.g. Snapdragon 845) where the hook-based drivers silently fall back to the system driver. The existing adrenotools drivers are unchanged; this is an additional option in the graphics-driver list.

> ⚠️ **Updating from a previous release? Reinstall imageFS to get the new Turnip driver.** The `turnip-26.1.0` driver is installed into imageFS, so a plain app update won't add it on its own. Open the app's **Settings → scroll to the bottom → Reinstall ImageFS**. (A **fresh** install of 2.0 already includes it — no action needed.)

> ℹ️ The OpenGL upscalers reuse the same SGSR (BSD-3, Qualcomm) and FSR / CAS (MIT, AMD GPUOpen) shader code as the Vulkan path, ported to the GLES effect pipeline. The Android-10 Turnip driver is Mesa's open-source **Turnip 26.1.0** (Freedreno team), packaged in the same direct-ICD form Winlator ships. See [Credits](#-credits).

## ✨ Full Features

Everything Bannerlator offers, at a glance. No PC and no root required — it runs Windows apps and games directly on your Android device.

### 🍷 Windows compatibility
- **Wine** Windows compatibility layer — run native Win32/Win64 applications and games.
- **Box64 / Box86** x86 & x86-64 → ARM translation, with selectable performance presets.
- **WOWBox64** for arm64ec containers (correctly labelled per container).
- **FEXCore** as an alternative x86/x64 emulation backend.
- **arm64ec** and **x64** container support.

### 🎨 Graphics & translation layers
- **DXVK** — DirectX 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 → Vulkan (with GPLAsync and Sarek variants).
- **VKD3D-Proton** — DirectX 12 → Vulkan.
- **WineD3D / DirectDraw** OpenGL fallback paths for older titles.
- **Proton bionic** translation layers (via GameNative).
- **VEGAS** — Adreno-optimized DXVK for reduced stutter and real-time upscaling on mobile GPUs.
- **Turnip / Mesa** open-source Adreno Vulkan drivers, with Timeline Semaphore patches for newer DXVK; bundled and downloadable driver options. A **`turnip-26.1.0`** option loads Turnip as a direct system Vulkan ICD (no adrenotools hook) so it works on **Android 10 / pre-11 devices** too.

### 🖥️ Renderers
- Multiple host renderers — **Vulkan**, **OpenGL**, and **VirGL**.
- > ℹ️ The **Vulkan host renderer** uses the rendering path from **[StevenMXZ](https://github.com/StevenMXZ/Winlator-Ludashi)** (Winlator-Ludashi); its `AHardwareBuffer` present path — what makes Vulkan / DXVK / VKD3D content actually display correctly — was ported from / cross-examined against **[GameNative](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative)**. See [Credits](#-credits).
- **Native Rendering+** — low-latency direct-scanout presentation on the Vulkan renderer (mutually exclusive with the Vulkan post-processing presets below, since it bypasses the compositor).
- **Spatial upscalers on *both* the Vulkan *and* OpenGL renderers** — **SGSR** (Snapdragon GSR 1.0) and **FSR / FSR-Fit** (AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0), plus a **Sharpen** (RCAS) mode and Linear / Nearest, all switchable live in the in-game drawer. On Vulkan it engages when a game renders below display resolution; on OpenGL it renders the scene at a reduced internal resolution and reconstructs it back up. Every sharpness slider runs 0 (off) → 100 (max).
- **Supersampling (Render scale)** — render above display resolution (1.25× / 1.5× / 2×) and downsample with a Lanczos-2 filter for DSR / OGSSAA-style anti-aliasing; set per container / per shortcut.
- **Screen effects on both the OpenGL *and* Vulkan renderers** — FXAA, Toon, CRT, NTSC, Color grading, **CAS** sharpening, and fake-HDR (the Vulkan path runs them through a new post-processing pipeline; previously they were OpenGL-only).
- Adjustable resolution and frame-rate limit.

### 🎞️ Frame generation & pacing
- **Two selectable frame-generation engines** — pick **Off / bionic-fg / lsfg-vk** per container; the running engine is shown as a badge in the in-game drawer.
  - **bionic-fg** — powered by the **[bionic-fg](https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/bionic-fg)** Vulkan layer (Lossless-Scaling lineage), bundled and ready to use out of the box.
  - **lsfg-vk** — powered by the **[lsfg-vk](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk)** Vulkan layer (Android port by [FrankBarretta](https://github.com/FrankBarretta/lsfg-vk-android)).
- > ⚠️ **lsfg-vk requires you to supply your own `Lossless.dll`.** Bannerlator bundles **no** proprietary Lossless Scaling files. You must own **[Lossless Scaling](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/)** (THS, on Steam) and import its `Lossless.dll` via **Settings → Frame Generation (lsfg-vk) → pick DLL**. The DLL is copied into app storage and serves all containers. Until you import a valid `Lossless.dll`, the **lsfg-vk** option stays greyed out; **bionic-fg** needs no DLL and works without it.
- **Live in-game controls** for whichever engine the container runs: switch between **Off / 2× / 3× / 4×** and adjust the **flow-scale** slider right from the in-game Graphics drawer, hot-reloaded with no restart.
- **FPS Limiter** — a **standalone, engine-independent** live frame cap. It paces the X11 Present extension by delaying the `IdleNotify` that frees the guest's buffer, so the game itself throttles (the in-game HUD reflects the cap and GPU/power draw drops). Works the same with frame gen **Off**, **bionic-fg**, or **lsfg-vk**, on both host renderers, all guest APIs. When **lsfg-vk** is multiplying (2×+) the limiter automatically steps aside so lsfg's own pacing governs — no double-cap. This guest-side present-pacing mechanism was ported from **[GameNative](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative)** (see [Credits](#-credits)).
- Confirmed on **both** the OpenGL and Vulkan host renderers.

### 📦 Containers
- Create and manage **multiple isolated Wine containers**.
- **Redesigned container cards** — a clean spec-chip layout (renderer · DXVK on top, driver · VKD3D · backend beneath) that matches the game cards.
- **Auto-close on game exit** — the session closes itself once the launched game quits (per-container "Close when game exits" toggle, on by default), so you're not left at a black Wine desktop.
- **Import / export** containers to move or back up setups.
- Per-container control of Wine version, graphics driver, DXVK / VKD3D version, Box64 preset, drive mappings, Z-drive selector, and environment variables.
- **Compatibility Layers download menu** — a cloud button on each component (Wine/Proton, DXVK, VKD3D, Box64/WOWBox64, FEXCore) opens a downloader to browse, install or remove versions, with **Wine/Proton tabs**, an **"in use"** marker, **install-from-file**, and **byte-accurate download + install progress bars**.

### 🕹️ Games, shortcuts & input
- **Game library** with grid or list layout, sorting, and installed/updated filters.
- **Redesigned game cards** — primary chips (renderer · DXVK · frame-gen) over a muted driver · VKD3D · backend line, with the resolution in the subtitle; long component names no longer blank the game title.
- Add shortcuts from external storage.
- **SteamGridDB** cover-art scraping.
- Per-game settings including display language / locale.
- **Customizable on-screen touch controls** and virtual gamepad overlays.
- **Physical controller** support (SDL2), plus touchpad / mouse emulation with adjustable cursor speed.

### 🛒 Built-in GOG store
- **Sign in with your [GOG](https://www.gog.com/) account** and browse your owned library directly in-app.
- **Download and install** your GOG games, with **cloud-save** sync and one-tap launch into a container.
- DRM-free titles only — Bannerlator does not bundle or circumvent any DRM; you install games you already own.

### 🧰 Bundled Start-menu utilities
- New containers ship with handy Windows tools in the Start menu — **Winlator File Manager (WFM)**, **AIO Graphics Test**, and **Game Controller Test**.
- **`.lnk` working-directory ("Start in") support** so shortcuts for apps that only run from their own folder launch correctly.

### 🎛️ Interface & in-game overlay
- Modern **Jetpack Compose** user interface.
- In-game overlay drawer for settings, input, and quick toggles.
- **Performance HUD** — FPS, frame time, CPU/GPU temperature, and RAM, in vertical or horizontal layout.
- **Customizable themes** — 8 presets plus an HSV colour picker, with dark mode.

### 📥 Builds & distribution
- **Three build flavors** with distinct package IDs — *standard*, *PuBG*, and *Ludashi*.
- **Optimized release builds** (not debug) for a smoother Compose UI, AOSP-testkey signed so updates install over previous installs.
- Continuous **GitHub Actions** action builds and tagged stable releases.

This build stands on a long chain of prior work — its direct lineage, plus the projects whose commits and work are cherry-picked and implemented here:

| Contributor | Contribution |
|---|---|
| **brunodev85** | Original [Winlator](https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator) — Wine + Box64 + Turnip on Android. Foundation of every fork below. Also serves the `input_controls` profiles consumed by this fork: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brunodev85/winlator/main/input_controls/> |
| **coffincolors** | [`cmod` Winlator fork](https://github.com/coffincolors/winlator) — package `com.winlator.cmod` and the customization layer this codebase is built on. |
| **Pipetto-crypto** | [Winlator Bionic fork](https://github.com/Pipetto-crypto/winlator) (the "Bionic" half of *Star Bionic*) and the upstream [Box64 fix branch](https://github.com/Pipetto-crypto/box64). Co-credited on cmod. |
| **jacojayy** | Maintainer of the [Star](https://github.com/jacojayy/star) line. Timeline Semaphore patches in the bundled Turnip driver for newer DXVK compatibility. Official site developer and maintainer. |
| **Star / Frost dev team** | The [star-emu](https://github.com/star-emu) team behind the original *Star Bionic* and *Winlator Frost* lines this build continues from. |
| **isygold** (AGBOOLA Israel Oluwagbogo) | [Star Engine / VEGAS](https://github.com/isygold/vegas-releases) — the Adreno-optimized DXVK fork this build's `v1.3-vegas` is named for, eliminating stutter and adding real-time upscaling on mobile GPUs, plus tuned [dxvk.conf profiles](https://github.com/isygold/DXVK.CONF-FILE-SETTINGS-). |
| **vivsi** | Controller support contributions. |
| **StevenMXZ** | [Winlator-Ludashi](https://github.com/StevenMXZ/Winlator-Ludashi) and extensive cherry-picked work implemented in this build. This includes the **new user interface** and the **Vulkan rendering** path — both of which were **still unreleased and unfinished at the time these builds and this repo were created** — along with various other cherry-picked commits. This work is set to be released properly in his upcoming **3.1**. The bundled **Winlator File Manager (`wfm.exe`)** — including its correct "Local Disk" drive-icon behaviour — is from StevenMXZ's **Winlator-Ludashi 3.1 hotfix** release. |
| **GameNative** | [GameNative](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative) by **utkarshdalal** — Proton bionic translation layers and cherry-picked commits adapted into this build. Its rendering pipeline was also the **reference used to fix and rewire Bannerlator's render options** — the `AHardwareBuffer` present path that makes Vulkan / DXVK / VKD3D content render correctly on both the OpenGL and Vulkan host renderers (GPUImage socket-buffer locking + EGLImage sampling, DRI3 direct-scanout, the Present extension's FLIP / COPY branches, and the Native Rendering+ direct-scanout path) was ported from and cross-examined against GameNative's implementation. The **standalone FPS limiter** is GameNative's too — its guest-side present-pacing mechanism (delaying the X11 Present `IdleNotify` to throttle the game itself, plus the rule that lsfg-vk's own pacing governs when its multiplier is ≥ 2) was ported from GameNative. |
| **xXJSONDeruloXx** | [bionic-fg](https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/bionic-fg) — the Android/bionic Vulkan **frame-generation** layer powering Bannerlator's Frame Generation feature. Included in-tree as a git submodule with the author's permission. |
| **PancakeTAS** | [lsfg-vk](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk) — the open-source Vulkan frame-generation layer (a Vulkan-layer reimplementation of Lossless Scaling's frame generation) that Bannerlator's **second, user-selectable FG engine** is built on. |
| **FrankBarretta** | [lsfg-vk-android](https://github.com/FrankBarretta/lsfg-vk-android) — the Android/bionic port of lsfg-vk (AHardwareBuffer path + `vkCmdPipelineBarrier2` shim) that runs as Bannerlator's lsfg-vk engine on the Turnip stack. The in-game live multiplier/flow-scale reload uses the `conf.toml` mtime-watch mechanism from **GameNative's** [lsfg-vk-android fork](https://github.com/GameNative). No proprietary shaders are bundled — users supply their own `Lossless.dll` ([Lossless Scaling](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/) by THS) via the in-app picker. |
| **leegao** (Lee Gao) | Vulkan texture-compression work used for mobile-GPU compatibility and performance — the [BCn decompression layer](https://github.com/leegao/bcn_layer) and real-time [ASTC/ETC compute-shader encoders](https://github.com/leegao). |
| **The412Banner** | Full Jetpack Compose UI migration, in-game overlay rewrite, controller-support restore (SDL2 SoName fix + four event files), Box64 edit-dialog fix, theme system, and CI/release infrastructure. Also maintains the [Nightlies WCP Hub](https://github.com/The412Banner/Nightlies) and [Banners-Turnip](https://github.com/The412Banner/Banners-Turnip). |
