## 📌 Project Notice

> **Bannerlator is a personal continuation of the Winlator *Star Bionic* project ([star-emu/star](https://github.com/star-emu/star)), which was recently discontinued and archived.**
>
> **None of the original developers are involved except me ([The412Banner](https://github.com/The412Banner)).** This project would not be possible without their hard work up to this point, together with cherry-picked commits from other open-source projects across the community — all credited below.
>
> This is **my personal build.** As always, it is **free for anyone to use as they see fit, or to share.**

## 🙏 Credits

This build stands on a long chain of prior work — its direct lineage, plus the projects whose commits and work are cherry-picked and implemented here:

| Contributor | Contribution |
|---|---|
| **brunodev85** | Original [Winlator](https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator) — Wine + Box64 + Turnip on Android. Foundation of every fork below. Also serves the `input_controls` profiles consumed by this fork: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brunodev85/winlator/main/input_controls/> |
| **coffincolors** | [`cmod` Winlator fork](https://github.com/coffincolors/winlator) — package `com.winlator.cmod` and the customization layer this codebase is built on. |
| **Pipetto-crypto** | [Winlator Bionic fork](https://github.com/Pipetto-crypto/winlator) (the "Bionic" half of *Star Bionic*) and the upstream [Box64 fix branch](https://github.com/Pipetto-crypto/box64). Co-credited on cmod. |
| **jacojayy** | Maintainer of the [Star](https://github.com/jacojayy/star) line. Timeline Semaphore patches in the bundled Turnip driver for newer DXVK compatibility. Official site developer and maintainer. |
| **Star / Frost dev team** | The [star-emu](https://github.com/star-emu) team behind the original *Star Bionic* and *Winlator Frost* lines this build continues from. |
| **isygold** (AGBOOLA Israel Oluwagbogo) | [Star Engine / VEGAS](https://github.com/isygold/vegas-releases) — the Adreno-optimized DXVK fork this build's `v1.3-vegas` is named for, eliminating stutter and adding real-time upscaling on mobile GPUs, plus tuned [dxvk.conf profiles](https://github.com/isygold/DXVK.CONF-FILE-SETTINGS-). |
| **vivsi** | Controller support contributions. |
| **StevenMXZ** | [Winlator-Ludashi](https://github.com/StevenMXZ/Winlator-Ludashi) — cherry-picked commits and work implemented in this build, including the `ludashi` package rename (Xiaomi performance-mode detection) and the `redmagic` (Genshin Impact package name for RedMagic frame-gen) variant handling. |
| **GameNative** | [GameNative](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative) by **utkarshdalal** — Proton bionic translation layers and cherry-picked commits adapted into this build. |
| **leegao** (Lee Gao) | Vulkan texture-compression work used for mobile-GPU compatibility and performance — the [BCn decompression layer](https://github.com/leegao/bcn_layer) and real-time [ASTC/ETC compute-shader encoders](https://github.com/leegao). |
| **The412Banner** | Full Jetpack Compose UI migration, in-game overlay rewrite, controller-support restore (SDL2 SoName fix + four event files), Box64 edit-dialog fix, theme system, and CI/release infrastructure. Also maintains the [Nightlies WCP Hub](https://github.com/The412Banner/Nightlies) and [Banners-Turnip](https://github.com/The412Banner/Banners-Turnip). |
