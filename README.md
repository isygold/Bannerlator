## 📌 Project Notice

> **Bannerlator is a personal continuation of the Winlator *Star Bionic* project ([star-emu/star](https://github.com/star-emu/star)), which was recently discontinued and archived.**
>
> **None of the original developers are involved except me ([The412Banner](https://github.com/The412Banner)).** This project would not be possible without their hard work up to this point, together with cherry-picked commits from other open-source projects across the community — all credited below.
>
> This is **my personal build.** As always, it is **free for anyone to use as they see fit, or to share.**

## ✨ Full Features

Everything Bannerlator offers, at a glance. No PC and no root required — it runs Windows apps and games directly on your Android device.

### 🍷 Windows compatibility
- **Wine** Windows compatibility layer — run native Win32/Win64 applications and games.
- **Box64 / Box86** x86 & x86-64 → ARM translation, with selectable performance presets.
- **WOWBox64** for arm64ec containers (correctly labelled per container).
- **FEXCore** as an alternative x86/x64 emulation backend.
- **arm64ec** and **x64** container support.

### 🎨 Graphics & translation layers
- **DXVK** — DirectX 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 → Vulkan (with GPLAsync and Sarek variants).
- **VKD3D-Proton** — DirectX 12 → Vulkan.
- **WineD3D / DirectDraw** OpenGL fallback paths for older titles.
- **Proton bionic** translation layers (via GameNative).
- **VEGAS** — Adreno-optimized DXVK for reduced stutter and real-time upscaling on mobile GPUs.
- **Turnip / Mesa** open-source Adreno Vulkan drivers, with Timeline Semaphore patches for newer DXVK; bundled and downloadable driver options.

### 🖥️ Renderers
- Multiple host renderers — **Vulkan**, **OpenGL**, and **VirGL**.
- **Native Rendering+** — low-latency direct-scanout presentation on the Vulkan renderer.
- **Screen effects** on the OpenGL renderer — FXAA, SGSR, HDR, CRT, Toon, and NTSC.
- Adjustable resolution and frame-rate limit.

### 🎞️ Frame generation & pacing
- **AI Frame Generation** powered by the **[bionic-fg](https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/bionic-fg)** Vulkan layer (Lossless-Scaling lineage) — interpolates extra frames for smoother motion.
- **Per-container toggle** plus **live in-game controls**: switch between **Off / 2× / 3× / 4×** and adjust the **flow-scale** slider right from the in-game Graphics drawer, hot-reloaded with no restart.
- **FPS Limiter** (10–200) — caps the base/real frame rate so on-screen FPS = limit × multiplier. Feeding the interpolator a steady cadence yields smoother output and lower power draw; it also works on its own (frame gen off) as a plain live FPS cap.
- Confirmed on **both** the OpenGL and Vulkan host renderers.

### 📦 Containers
- Create and manage **multiple isolated Wine containers**.
- **Import / export** containers to move or back up setups.
- Per-container control of Wine version, graphics driver, DXVK / VKD3D version, Box64 preset, drive mappings, Z-drive selector, and environment variables.
- **One-tap component downloads** (Wine, DXVK, VKD3D, Box64, VEGAS) with on-card download & install progress.

### 🕹️ Games, shortcuts & input
- **Game library** with grid or list layout, sorting, and installed/updated filters.
- Add shortcuts from external storage.
- **SteamGridDB** cover-art scraping.
- Per-game settings including display language / locale.
- **Customizable on-screen touch controls** and virtual gamepad overlays.
- **Physical controller** support (SDL2), plus touchpad / mouse emulation with adjustable cursor speed.

### 🎛️ Interface & in-game overlay
- Modern **Jetpack Compose** user interface.
- In-game overlay drawer for settings, input, and quick toggles.
- **Performance HUD** — FPS, frame time, CPU/GPU temperature, and RAM, in vertical or horizontal layout.
- **Customizable themes** — 8 presets plus an HSV colour picker, with dark mode.

### 📥 Builds & distribution
- **Three build flavors** with distinct package IDs — *standard*, *PuBG*, and *Ludashi*.
- Continuous **GitHub Actions** action builds and tagged stable releases.

## 🎮 Frontends Workaround

Bannerlator does not work by itself on frontends out of the box. See the [frontends workaround guide](https://github.com/star-emu/star/blob/marcescence/marcescence-frontends.md) to get it running.

---

## 🛠️ Building

This project is built via **GitHub Actions only** — local builds are not supported.

- **Action builds** — every fix is compiled and published as a downloadable workflow artifact.
- **Releases** — tagged stable builds are published as GitHub Releases.

## 🙏 Credits

This build stands on a long chain of prior work — its direct lineage, plus the projects whose commits and work are cherry-picked and implemented here:

| Contributor | Contribution |
|---|---|
| **brunodev85** | Original [Winlator](https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator) — Wine + Box64 + Turnip on Android. Foundation of every fork below. Also serves the `input_controls` profiles consumed by this fork: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brunodev85/winlator/main/input_controls/> |
| **coffincolors** | [`cmod` Winlator fork](https://github.com/coffincolors/winlator) — package `com.winlator.cmod` and the customization layer this codebase is built on. |
| **Pipetto-crypto** | [Winlator Bionic fork](https://github.com/Pipetto-crypto/winlator) (the "Bionic" half of *Star Bionic*) and the upstream [Box64 fix branch](https://github.com/Pipetto-crypto/box64). Co-credited on cmod. |
| **jacojayy** | Maintainer of the [Star](https://github.com/jacojayy/star) line. Timeline Semaphore patches in the bundled Turnip driver for newer DXVK compatibility. Official site developer and maintainer. |
| **Star / Frost dev team** | The [star-emu](https://github.com/star-emu) team behind the original *Star Bionic* and *Winlator Frost* lines this build continues from. |
| **isygold** (AGBOOLA Israel Oluwagbogo) | [Star Engine / VEGAS](https://github.com/isygold/vegas-releases) — the Adreno-optimized DXVK fork this build's `v1.3-vegas` is named for, eliminating stutter and adding real-time upscaling on mobile GPUs, plus tuned [dxvk.conf profiles](https://github.com/isygold/DXVK.CONF-FILE-SETTINGS-). |
| **vivsi** | Controller support contributions. |
| **StevenMXZ** | [Winlator-Ludashi](https://github.com/StevenMXZ/Winlator-Ludashi) and extensive cherry-picked work implemented in this build. This includes the **new user interface** and the **Vulkan rendering** path — both of which were **still unreleased and unfinished at the time these builds and this repo were created** — along with various other cherry-picked commits. This work is set to be released properly in his upcoming **3.1**. |
| **GameNative** | [GameNative](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative) by **utkarshdalal** — Proton bionic translation layers and cherry-picked commits adapted into this build. Its rendering pipeline was also the **reference used to fix and rewire Bannerlator's render options** — the `AHardwareBuffer` present path that makes Vulkan / DXVK / VKD3D content render correctly on both the OpenGL and Vulkan host renderers (GPUImage socket-buffer locking + EGLImage sampling, DRI3 direct-scanout, the Present extension's FLIP / COPY branches, and the Native Rendering+ direct-scanout path) was ported from and cross-examined against GameNative's implementation. |
| **xXJSONDeruloXx** | [bionic-fg](https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/bionic-fg) — the Android/bionic Vulkan **frame-generation** layer powering Bannerlator's Frame Generation feature. Included in-tree as a git submodule with the author's permission. |
| **PancakeTAS** | [lsfg-vk](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk) — the open-source Vulkan frame-generation layer (a Vulkan-layer reimplementation of Lossless Scaling's frame generation) that Bannerlator's **second, user-selectable FG engine** is built on. |
| **FrankBarretta** | [lsfg-vk-android](https://github.com/FrankBarretta/lsfg-vk-android) — the Android/bionic port of lsfg-vk (AHardwareBuffer path + `vkCmdPipelineBarrier2` shim) that runs as Bannerlator's lsfg-vk engine on the Turnip stack. The in-game live multiplier/flow-scale reload uses the `conf.toml` mtime-watch mechanism from **GameNative's** [lsfg-vk-android fork](https://github.com/GameNative). No proprietary shaders are bundled — users supply their own `Lossless.dll` ([Lossless Scaling](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/) by THS) via the in-app picker. |
| **leegao** (Lee Gao) | Vulkan texture-compression work used for mobile-GPU compatibility and performance — the [BCn decompression layer](https://github.com/leegao/bcn_layer) and real-time [ASTC/ETC compute-shader encoders](https://github.com/leegao). |
| **The412Banner** | Full Jetpack Compose UI migration, in-game overlay rewrite, controller-support restore (SDL2 SoName fix + four event files), Box64 edit-dialog fix, theme system, and CI/release infrastructure. Also maintains the [Nightlies WCP Hub](https://github.com/The412Banner/Nightlies) and [Banners-Turnip](https://github.com/The412Banner/Banners-Turnip). |
